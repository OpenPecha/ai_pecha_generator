From the text "Illuminating the Intent", this is the sixth chapter on awakening mind, verses 1 through 64
Here's how to understand the Sixth Ground called "The Manifest." It has four main parts: first, we learn what this ground means and how it relates to perfect wisdom; second, we hear praise about perfect wisdom; third, we learn about ultimate reality by understanding deep interconnectedness; and finally, we wrap up by listing the special qualities of this ground.
When practitioners reach the fifth ground, they perfect their meditation skills. This allows them to move to the sixth ground, called "Directly Facing." At this level, they can maintain perfect concentration. This deep concentration helps them understand how everything depends on causes and conditions - a profound truth about reality. Because they now have perfect wisdom on the sixth ground, they can reach a state of complete peace (cessation). This wasn't possible on the fifth ground or earlier because their wisdom wasn't perfect enough yet. Just being good at generosity and the other four perfections isn't enough to reach this state.
This level is called The Manifest because of three things: you can directly see the mirror-like nature of reality through deep wisdom, you focus on understanding the true path at the fifth ground, and you're moving closer to becoming a perfect buddha.
The Commentary tells us about two reasons. The second reason is about reaching a state where we no longer see a difference between the knower and what is known. While practitioners at the fifth ground work with the truth of the path (which is the last of the four truths), they become experts in understanding both the obvious and subtle aspects of the four truths. By the sixth ground, they perfect their wisdom about these four truths. The first reason shows how practitioners perfect their understanding of how things arise and cease (dependent origination) in both forward and reverse order. So, by mastering these two types of wisdom training, they directly experience both the truths and dependent origination.
At this stage, you complete the three wisdom trainings. As your meditation becomes calmer, your insight grows equally stronger. Because you mastered perfect meditation in the fifth stage, you now achieve perfect wisdom here. This is why you can now enter a special state of complete stillness.
The Precious Garland teaches us about the sixth level, called "Directly Facing." It's called this because at this level, a person directly faces the Buddha's teachings. By practicing both calm meditation and deep insight, they reach a state of complete peace and grow spiritually. Because of this good practice, they are reborn as a king of the Nirmanarati gods. Since even the great disciples called śrāvakas can't outshine them at this level, it helps humble those who are too proud. The text explains that Nirmanarati means the gods who enjoy creating things.
Here's the second point: Think of someone who can see leading a group of blind people. They can easily guide the blind to where they want to go. In the same way, the perfection of wisdom guides other good qualities like generosity, which are like blind people because they can't see the true nature of things. The perfection of wisdom leads them to the state of enlightenment because it can clearly tell the difference between right and wrong paths.
The Noble Condensed Perfection of Wisdom says: "Think of billions of blind people without anyone to guide them - they can't find their way to a city because they don't know the path. In the same way, without wisdom to guide them, the other five perfections are like blind people - they can't reach enlightenment."$$The Diamond Cutter adds: "Imagine someone with good eyesight who walks into a dark room - they can't see anything. That's what it's like when a bodhisattva gives gifts while thinking things exist in a solid way. Subhuti, it's like when the sun comes up and someone with good eyes can suddenly see everything clearly - that's what it's like when a bodhisattva gives gifts without getting caught up in thinking things exist solidly." This same idea works for good behavior and all the other perfections too.
The third section contains five easy steps: First, making a promise to explain the deep meaning. Second, finding the right people who can understand the deep teaching. Third, describing the good things that happen when teaching these people. Fourth, encouraging the right people to listen carefully. Fifth, showing how to explain the true nature of how things depend on each other.
Here's the first point: Someone asks, "When a bodhisattva at the sixth level sees how things depend on each other, how do they understand the true nature of 'this happens because of that'?" The commentary answers this by saying: We can't understand this because our minds are completely covered by thick clouds of confusion. Only those who have reached the sixth level and higher can understand it. So we're not the ones who should be asked about this. Instead, ask the buddhas and advanced bodhisattvas - they've cleared away their confusion and have used the medicine of understanding emptiness to heal their spiritual vision.
When someone asks about seeing the true nature of reality, the Buddha says to ask those who have experienced it themselves. It's like putting medicine in your eyes - it helps you see better but doesn't take your eyes out. Similarly, understanding emptiness is like eye medicine for your mind - it makes your understanding clearer but doesn't remove your wisdom. If you understand this, you won't fall into the wrong belief that claims there's no wisdom during an arya's meditation. Someone might say "But don't the Prajnaparamita Sutra and the Ten Grounds Sutra teach that bodhisattvas practicing wisdom can see the true nature of dependent origination? So shouldn't we explain it based on these texts?" However, since it's hard to fully understand what the scriptures really mean, even I can't teach the true nature of reality just by quoting scriptures.
Here's how we explain this independently: We know that trustworthy teachers who understand reality wrote important texts that correctly explain the Buddhist scriptures. Through these texts, we can understand what the scriptures really mean. For example, just as a bodhisattva at the sixth level understands the deepest teachings, Nāgārjuna perfectly understood the scriptures. In his Madhyamaka texts, he clearly showed the true nature of things using both quotes from Buddhist sutras and logical reasoning. So, I'm going to explain things exactly as Nāgārjuna taught them, following how Candrakīrti explained Nāgārjuna's tradition.
Someone asked how Nāgārjuna correctly understood what the Buddhist scriptures really meant. We can find the answer in a text called the Descent into Laṅkā. This text says: "In the southern country of Vidarbha, there will be a famous monk called Nāga. He will show that things don't simply exist or not exist. He will teach the Great Vehicle, which is the highest form of Buddhist teaching. After reaching a spiritual level called Perfect Joy, he will go to a pure land called Sukhāvatī." This shows that Nāgārjuna would explain the true meaning of Buddhism, which goes beyond saying things either exist or don't exist.
This story comes from the Sublime Golden Light Sutra. There was a young man from the Licchavi clan named Lokapriyadarśanā who lived when the Buddha was alive. According to the Great Clouds Sutra, the Buddha said: "Four hundred years after I die, this young man will become a monk named Nāga. He will help spread my teachings. Later, he will become a buddha named Jñānākaraprabha in a pure land called Utterly Transparent Light." This proves there is a true prophecy about this person in the authentic teachings.
The text called Mañjuśrī's Root Realizations also mentions when he would appear and what his name would be, just like previously described, and says he would live for 600 years. The Great Drum Sutra tells us about a young man from Licchavi named Lokapriyadarśanā. It says that 80 years after the Buddha passed away, when the Buddhist teachings were declining, this person would become a monk using the Buddha's name. He would help spread Buddhism again, and after living for 100 years, he would die and be reborn in Sukhāvatī paradise. Two important teachers, Elder Bodhibhadra and Master Atiśa, believe this prediction is actually talking about Nāgārjuna, because they say Lokapriyadarśanā and Nāgārjuna are the same person. The Great Drum Sutra also mentions that this monk reached the seventh level of enlightenment. These different descriptions don't contradict each other, because we often see in Buddhist texts that the same beings are sometimes described as beginning-level practitioners (stream-enterers) and sometimes as fully enlightened buddhas.
These deep teachings should only be shared with people who have already become familiar with them before and have developed some understanding of emptiness. Don't teach them to others because even if they listen to texts about emptiness, they will misunderstand it and this can cause them serious problems.
Here's how serious problems can happen: Sometimes people who don't understand properly will reject emptiness and end up in lower realms. Other times, they misunderstand what emptiness means - thinking that when we say things lack inherent existence, it means things don't exist at all. They first develop this wrong view that denies the reality of causes and effects, and then they keep building on this mistaken idea, making it stronger and stronger.
In Candrakīrti's text called Clear Words, he explains a verse that says: "When people with limited understanding misunderstand emptiness, it harms them - just like grabbing a snake the wrong way or doing a magic spell incorrectly." He explains that we shouldn't reject everyday reality, and we should accept that actions have consequences, like reflections in a mirror. At the same time, we should understand that things don't exist independently. If we don't follow these two principles, we fall into extreme views of either thinking things last forever or thinking nothing exists at all. If someone thinks that things don't exist at all, that's a wrong view. Even though there might be different ways to say "doesn't exist," when you really think about it carefully, they all mean the same thing.
When explaining a verse from the Four Hundred Stanzas that says "One person goes to lower realms, and another goes to a special kind of peace," Candrakīrti explains something important. He says that when people who aren't spiritually ready hear teachings about selflessness, they can react in two ways - they might reject it completely or understand it wrongly. Both reactions lead them to lower realms. When he talks about understanding it wrongly, he means thinking that emptiness means nothing exists. This is why we need to be careful. Some people don't have the mental ability to understand these very deep ideas, but they think they do. They might get very excited about just the words of these deep teachings, even though the teachings are beyond what they can understand. This can cause them serious problems. So we need to be very careful about this. This raises a question: how should we teach emptiness to such people?
"How do we know if someone shouldn't be taught about emptiness? We can tell by looking for certain signs. When beginners first hear about emptiness explained correctly, they show specific reactions: they feel deep joy again and again, their eyes fill with tears, and they get goosebumps. When someone reacts this way, it means they have what we call a 'seed' - a natural capacity to understand emptiness and develop the special wisdom that Buddhas have. These are the right kind of students for a qualified teacher to teach about ultimate truth. The details of this truth will be explained later.
Here's what this means: If you hear the correct teachings about emptiness and actually understand them, certain physical signs will show up - and these are definite proof. If you either don't understand the teaching, or you understand it but don't show these signs, we can't be sure yet if you're ready for the deep teachings. But don't worry - if you follow your holy lama's instructions carefully, you can still become someone who can develop many new abilities to understand emptiness.
Third: When we teach emptiness to these students, it will definitely be worthwhile. Why? Because not only will they avoid getting confused and harmed by misunderstanding emptiness, they will also gain all the good results that come from learning about the true nature of emptiness.
What's this all about? When someone is ready to learn, they feel that hearing teachings about emptiness is like finding buried treasure. They want to keep this understanding in their future lives too, so they make sure to live by good moral rules. They think to themselves, "If I break these rules and end up in the lower realms, I'll lose my understanding of emptiness." That's why they take up these moral rules and stick to them carefully. You don't need to have taken formal vows to break moral discipline - just doing naturally wrong things is enough to break it. They also worry that even if they're born in better realms by following good rules, being too poor to afford basic needs like food and medicine would force them to focus on survival instead of studying emptiness. So they practice giving to both spiritual and ordinary people, just as mentioned before.
When you understand emptiness while having great compassion (as previously taught), this leads to becoming a buddha - nothing else will work. Knowing this, you should practice getting familiar with great compassion as your foundation. You should practice patience because anger leads to three bad outcomes: rebirth in lower realms, destruction of good deeds, and getting an ugly appearance - which makes the noble ones unhappy with you. If you don't keep dedicating your good actions like maintaining discipline towards becoming all-knowing, these won't help you become a buddha and won't give you endless good results like having good bodies and enjoyments. So you should dedicate all these good actions towards freeing beings from the cycle of existence.
When people see that śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas and others cannot teach deep dependent origination as well as bodhisattvas can, they develop deep respect for bodhisattvas who are working towards perfect enlightenment. When Mahayana practitioners truly understand emptiness, they develop a clear understanding of what was explained before and become very dedicated to practicing all the vast aspects of the path. This is something really worth praising. As the Bodhicittavivaraṇa says: "When someone understands that things are empty but still believes in karma and its results, that's more amazing than amazing, more wonderful than wonderful!" This applies to people who avoid two mistakes: those who don't believe and reject the teachings, and those who seem to believe but wrongly think it means nothing causes anything. Instead, they understand that seeing things as empty actually makes better sense of how everything works.
If someone misunderstands this, they might claim they've found the true view and then treat all teachings about karma and good behavior like they're counting horns on a rabbit - which don't exist. They'll say these teachings are only for people who don't get the deeper meaning, while those who do understand don't need them. They think everything is just made up in our minds, and any thinking shows we're still stuck believing things are real. Like Heshang Moheyan from China, they end up destroying all good practices.
Some people say we should follow rules of right and wrong temporarily when we're still confused. But here's the problem: If we say our thoughts either grasp at true existence or don't, then using logic to disprove inherent existence would end up disproving everything, which makes no sense. And if we don't make this distinction, then our understanding of emptiness and our ethical behavior would cancel each other out, like hot and cold. Plus, we can't even establish the confused perspective itself, who's establishing it, or what's being established - there's no foundation for any of it. This whole argument comes from confusion in the dark. So this view actually falls into exactly what those earlier texts were arguing against.
If you have learned both the deep and broad teachings well, you'll need to gather positive energy in both these areas for a long time while you're still an ordinary person. This will help you reach the state called Perfect Joy step by step. So if you want to reach Perfect Joy, please listen carefully to this deep spiritual path I'm going to explain.
The Commentary on the Four Hundred Stanzas explains: When someone shows interest in learning about emptiness, we should help create the right conditions to strengthen their interest. They should develop deep compassion and gratitude towards the Buddha, and want to avoid things that block their spiritual progress. They should overcome their fears and practice giving, even when it's difficult. They should also use the four ways of gathering students. We should put all our effort into teaching this sacred teaching to people who are ready to receive it. This means we need to teach carefully to people who don't have the two problems that make them unsuitable students. Even for people who are interested but don't fully understand, we should teach in ways that don't confuse their understanding of how things depend on each other.
When a knowledgeable teacher teaches students who can understand the teachings (even if they're just beginners), this creates a lot of good karma. The Compendium of Sutras says that having faith in deep teachings builds up all kinds of good karma. Until you become a Buddha, you'll get all the good things both in this world and beyond. In the Gift of Youth Ratna Sutra, it says: "Mañjuśrī, someone who just listens to these teachings with doubt creates more good karma than a Bodhisattva who practices the six perfections for hundreds of thousands of years without knowing the right methods. So imagine how much more beneficial it is to listen without any doubt! And even better - writing it down, teaching it to others, keeping the teachings alive, and sharing them widely with everyone else!"
In the Diamond Cutter text, the Buddha asked Subhuti: "What do you think? Imagine if we had as many Ganges rivers as there are grains of sand in the current Ganges river. Would all the sand in those rivers be a huge amount?" Subhuti answered, "Dear Buddha, just having that many rivers would already be an enormous number, so the amount of sand in all of them would be unimaginable!" Then the Buddha said, "Listen carefully, Subhuti. Here's what you need to understand: If someone took all the worlds that equal the number of sand grains in those rivers and filled them with seven kinds of precious jewels as an offering to the Buddha, would they gain a lot of spiritual merit?" Subhuti replied, "Yes, Blessed One, they would gain an enormous amount of merit. Indeed they would, Perfect One!"
The Blessed One said: "If someone remembers just four lines from this teaching and teaches it to others, they will create much more merit than before." The Treasury of Tathāgatas Sutra lists the ten major bad actions and says that if someone who has done these bad things understands that there is no permanent self and believes that everything has always been pure, they won't be reborn in bad places. The Chapter on Defeating the Māras says that when a monk understands that everything is naturally calm and that mistakes have always been empty of real existence, and when they let go of guilt without making it worse, they can overcome even the worst actions - so minor mistakes in rules and behavior aren't even worth mentioning. The Ajātaśatru Sutra says that if someone who has done terrible things hears this teaching and believes in it, their actions won't block their spiritual progress. These are the benefits of teaching, learning, and thinking about these deep meanings, both during formal practice and at other times.
To get the most benefit from teaching, you need two things: First, you should teach with pure intentions, not trying to get gifts, praise, or fame. Second, you need to explain the Dharma correctly without misunderstanding its meaning. If you teach with either of these problems (wrong motivation or wrong understanding), or both, you'll block yourself from gaining merit. Master Vasubandhu explained this by saying that people who teach the Dharma wrongly or teach because they want gifts, respect, and fame are just hurting their own merit. This applies to our situation too. Students also need to have pure intentions and correct understanding when they listen. So both teachers and students should have at least these basic qualities when they teach or study. This topic has three main parts: how reality is explained in the scriptures, how we can prove what the scriptures say through reasoning, and how we can understand different types of emptiness from this. The first part breaks down into two sections: what the scriptures say and what stops us from understanding reality correctly.
According to the Ten Grounds Sutra, when a bodhisattva is ready to move from the fifth level to the sixth level, they need to understand ten ways that all things are equal. What are these ten? First, all things are equally without signs or marks. Second, all things are equally without defining features. Similarly, all things are equally unborn, non-arising, empty, pure from the beginning, free from complications, and neither accepted nor rejected. Next, all things are equally like magic tricks, dreams, illusions, echoes, reflections in water, mirror images, and magical creations. Finally, all things are equally beyond being real or unreal. When someone truly understands this, they develop a special kind of acceptance that helps them reach the sixth level, called The Manifest. The word "similarly" means we should say "all things" before each quality up to "neither accepted nor rejected." We count the first two as one type of equality, the seven examples as another type, and the last two as one more type. While the Commentary on the Ten Grounds Sutra and the Bodhisattva Grounds explain these ten equalities differently, and because they understand emptiness differently from our tradition, we explain it our own way. The first type of equality means that when advanced practitioners meditate deeply, they see that things don't have different characteristics.
Here's how to understand the ten types of equality: The second type shows that all things are equal because none of them exist by themselves. The first two types give us the basic idea. The other eight types explain this idea in more detail. For example, nothing can arise in the future, and nothing has been born in other times. This equality applies to everything. Things are empty of both future arising and past birth. This emptiness isn't created by books or logic - it's always been pure, and that's the sixth type. The seventh type means there are no dual appearances, connecting to the first equality. The eighth follows the same pattern. The ninth type uses many examples to prove these points. The tenth type shows that all things are equal in not existing as either real or unreal. "Sharp" means quick understanding, and "compatible" matches the acceptance of non-arising found in the eighth ground of enlightenment. While many texts explain the true nature of things, this teaching specifically shows how wisdom on the sixth ground understands reality through these ten equalities.
When we say that nothing truly exists, we need to understand two things properly: what "truly existing" means and how we normally grasp things as truly existing. If we don't understand these well, we'll definitely misunderstand emptiness. As the Bodhicharyavatara says: "If you don't understand what something is, you can't understand its absence." This means if we don't clearly see in our minds what we're trying to negate, we can't properly understand its absence.$$So if we don't clearly understand what "true existence" is (the thing that doesn't actually exist) and what things are empty of, we can't properly understand the nature of emptiness. It's not enough to just understand how philosophers define true existence. What's really important is understanding the natural way we all grasp at true existence - something that's been with us since forever, whether we've studied philosophy or not. Without understanding this natural grasping, even if we use logical arguments, we won't address our deep-seated belief in true existence.$$To do this right, we first need to identify our own natural grasping at true existence, then understand how different logical arguments work to eliminate what we're grasping at. Just arguing about it theoretically won't help much. Understanding how both Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika Madhyamaka schools explain this will help us see their subtle differences.
Here's the first point: While other trusted Svātantrika writings don't clearly say what they're trying to disprove, Kamalaśīla's Madhyamakaloka shows us that whatever is opposite to conventional existence must be ultimate or true existence. The text explains that our confused mind makes things seem real when they actually aren't. This confusion is called "conventional" because it hides the true nature of reality. $$As a sacred text tells us, things only seem to arise in the conventional world, but in ultimate reality, they have no inherent nature. When we misunderstand this lack of inherent nature, that's what we call conventional truth. This confusion comes from habits we've had since beginningless time, making all living beings see things as if they were truly real.$$This isn't something we see with our physical senses - it's in our thinking mind. The Commentary on Two Truths confirms this, saying our senses don't actually perceive true existence. This mistaken way of seeing things is natural to all beings, affecting both their logical thinking and direct experience. Things exist only in this conventional way, not because they're truly real. When we think things exist independently, without depending on our mind's perception, that's what we call ultimate or true existence, and naturally believing in this kind of existence is what we call innate grasping at true existence.
Someone might ask about a quote from the Light of the Middle Way that says "nothing truly exists in an ultimate sense." The text explains this means these things aren't proven by perfect understanding. So how can we make sense of this when it seems to suggest that ultimate existence is proven by logical reasoning that understands reality? The answer is that we need to understand two different meanings of "ultimate." The first meaning refers to understanding gained through study, thinking, and meditation. The second meaning refers to how things might exist independently, without depending on our mind. Things can exist in the first sense but not in the second sense. While something existing in the second way must also exist in the first way, believing in the first kind of existence isn't the same as our natural tendency to believe things exist truly. Understanding this difference helps us avoid confusion about whether ultimate reality exists or not.
Here's how to understand things that exist because our minds create them versus things that exist on their own. Let's use the example of a magic show. When a magician turns sticks and stones into horses and oxen, there are three people watching: the magician, people whose eyes are tricked by the magic, and people who aren't fooled. The magician sees the horses and oxen but knows they aren't real. The tricked audience both sees them and believes they're real. The people who aren't fooled don't see horses and oxen at all. It's like when someone mistakes a rope for a snake - in their mind it's a snake, but that doesn't make it actually a snake. The magician understands that the horses and oxen only exist because of confused minds, not because the sticks and stones actually turned into animals. But the tricked audience thinks they're seeing real horses and oxen standing right there in front of them.
Here's how we can understand whether things exist just in our minds or not, using an example. When we see something, there are two possibilities: either it really exists the way we see it, or it doesn't. This helps us understand an important point. Some people say "Well, since we use our minds (valid cognitions) to know things, and these valid cognitions are mental processes, doesn't this mean everything is just created by our minds? If so, even Buddhist essentialists would have to admit nothing truly exists." But this mixes up two different ideas. When we say valid cognitions establish things, we mean they help us understand how things really exist - this is completely different from saying our minds create reality.
Here's how illusions work: The Yogācāra-Madhyamaka school says we know illusions through self-awareness, while the Svātantrika school, which believes in external objects, says we know them through our senses perceiving things like the ground or space. We can prove these things aren't real the way they appear because if they were real, people with normal eyesight would see them - but they don't. When we understand both how something appears and how it's empty of that appearance, ordinary people who aren't studying philosophy would call this false. This understanding isn't the same as either basic or advanced logical reasoning. Even in everyday thinking, if something appears one way, it can't be empty of that appearance, and if it's empty of something, it can't appear that way. So when both happen together, it must be false from an ordinary point of view.
Here's how to understand true existence: Imagine people watching a magic show with tricked eyes. In the same way, living beings see things in the world as if they truly exist on their own. The Svātantrika school's way of explaining this is much simpler than how the Prāsaṅgikas explain it, so it's not the deeper understanding we're looking for.$$When you use logic to show that things don't truly exist the way we think they do, you become like the magician who knows the trick. You stop seeing things as existing independently and understand that they only exist because our minds make them appear that way. But remember - just because our mind thinks something exists doesn't automatically make it real. We need valid reasoning to back it up.$$Think about a seed growing into a plant. Yes, our mind helps us understand this process, but that doesn't mean the plant isn't really growing from the seed. It's like when a magician makes you see a horse or elephant - there's still something real there that appears that way. The same goes for everything in our everyday world, even the ultimate nature of reality - it all exists through how it appears to our mind.
You know how a magic trick might look like a horse or an ox, but it's not actually those things? Well, the same goes for everything else - like vases and such. But that's not really what we mean when we compare things to illusions. If that's what we meant, nothing could truly be itself, and we'd only be talking about how things look rather than what they are.When someone reaches that special state called nonconceptual gnosis during deep meditation (meditative equipoise), they stop seeing things as separate or dual - just like someone with good eyesight doesn't fall for or get confused by a magic trick.Now, the Svātantrika Madhyamaka school has a special way of explaining this, which I'll explain simply since we won't get into their detailed arguments later. They say everything we can know is either "something" or "nothing." Let's talk about the "somethings": They're either physical or non-physical. For physical things, they say nothing can exist without having sides (like east, west, etc.). For thoughts and feelings, they say no moment can exist without being connected to other moments. Everything that exists must have parts. And these parts can't be separate from the whole thing - they must be one and the same, otherwise they wouldn't be connected at all.
When you look closely at something, you'll notice that even though it has one basic nature, it seems to show up as different things. It's like a magic trick - you can see something appear but know it's empty of real existence at the same time. This double nature works fine if we're talking about things that only exist because our minds perceive them that way. But it wouldn't make sense for things that are supposed to exist independently of our minds. Why? Because if something truly exists, there can't be any difference between how it appears and what it really is - it would have to be completely real in every way. Also, if our mind sees things as different when they're actually one thing, that mind can't be seeing things correctly.
Here's what this means: Once we prove that things lack true existence, we can use the same logic for unconditioned things too. Take space, for example - it has to spread out over physical objects, with one part covering the east and other parts covering other directions. The same goes for ultimate reality - it has different parts that spread out, and our mind understands these parts at different times. Other unconditioned things work the same way. Since you can't separate parts from the whole thing they make up, they must be the same thing. This works fine for things that are conventionally false, but not for things that are supposed to be truly real. Using this reasoning, we can show that nothing at all has true existence. This is what Śāntarakṣita and Kamalaśīla taught. So it's wrong to think this only applies to physical things. The kind of falseness that ordinary people understand isn't the same as what the Madhyamaka philosophers mean by falseness. While we can say things exist in the ordinary way people think about them, in our system we don't accept that's all there is to it.
Here's what this means: Nothing exists completely independently of how our mind perceives it. However, in this system, things can exist in a way that depends on our mind but isn't just a mere label. This creates an important difference between how the two Madhyamaka schools understand what they're trying to disprove. I'm explaining it this way because I've noticed that people understand the view better when they first learn about this system's way of identifying true existence and our attachment to it, along with the basic reasoning that disproves these, before learning about the Prāsaṅgika Madhyamaka system.
Second, this tradition teaches that when you understand how things exist just because we think about them in certain ways, it becomes easy to recognize the mistake of thinking things exist independently. This topic has two parts: how things exist through our thoughts about them, and the mistaken view that things exist independently of our thoughts.
First, let me share what the Questions of Upāli says: "Think about beautiful flowers blooming and golden palaces shining - no one actually made these things. They only exist because our minds think about them. The whole world exists because of our thoughts." This teaches us that everything exists because of how we think about it. Many other teachings say the same thing - that everything is just created by our thoughts. The Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning asks: "The Buddha taught that the world exists because of ignorance, so why shouldn't we say the world is just our thoughts?" The explanation of this text tells us that the world isn't real by itself - it's just created by our thoughts. The Four Hundred also says: "If things like desire don't exist without thoughts about them, what smart person would think things are both real and just thoughts?" The explanation says: "Things that only exist when we think about them, and don't exist when we don't think about them, are like seeing a rope and thinking it's a snake - they're not real by themselves." Here, "real" means existing by itself.
Here's what happens: Our mind creates concepts based on what it sees. The commentary uses an example of how we might mistake a rope for a snake, just like how we experience attachment and other feelings. This example shows how all things exist in our mind through concepts rather than on their own. Think about it - when you see a coiled rope in dim light that looks snake-like, your mind jumps to "That's a snake!" But there's nothing about that rope - whether you look at all of it or just parts of it - that actually makes it a snake. It's just your mind creating that idea. The same thing happens with our sense of "I" or self. When we think "I am" while looking at our body and mind (the aggregates), there's nothing in these parts - whether you look at them across time or all at once - that actually is this "I" we're thinking of. We'll explain this more later. The point is, there's no "self" that exists separately from these parts of our experience - it's just our mind creating that idea based on what we observe.
The Precious Garland teaches us something interesting: It asks "What makes a person? A person isn't made of earth, water, fire, wind, space, or consciousness. And if a person isn't any of these things or even all of them together, then what exactly is a person?" $$When we talk about a "person" here, we mean an individual, a living being, our sense of "I" or self. The text explains that a person isn't just physical elements like earth or water, isn't just consciousness, and isn't just all these things combined. It also says a person isn't something completely separate from these elements either. $$However, this doesn't mean we should deny that people exist. Also, we shouldn't think of a person as just being consciousness (including foundation consciousness). This is how the commentator explained it, and this is what Nāgārjuna meant too.
Here's how to understand the way things exist: When you understand that a person is just a mental label, you can apply this to everything else too. The King of Meditative Stabilization Sutra teaches us that however you understand yourself, you should think about everything else the same way. The Noble Compilation Sutra says to understand all living beings like you understand yourself, and understand all things like you understand all beings. The Precious Garland explains that since a person is made up of six elements, they don't truly exist on their own. The same goes for each element - they're made of parts too, so they also don't truly exist by themselves. When something depends on its parts to exist, you can't say either the parts or the whole is the real thing, and nothing else can be it either. While pots and other objects are mental labels like mistaking a rope for a snake, there's a big difference - pots actually work and exist in our everyday world, while rope-snakes don't. This shows up in how we use these things in daily life and whether using them makes sense or not.
When looking at people who wrote explanations of Buddhist texts, three teachers - Buddhapālita, Śāntideva, and Candrakīrti - had a special way of explaining what Nāgārjuna and his followers taught. This is actually one of the hardest parts of understanding the Middle Way philosophy. The Precious Garland explains it like this:$$Physical things are just names,$Even space is just a name.$If there are no basic elements, how can physical things exist?$So even names themselves don't really exist.$$Feelings, perceptions, mental patterns,$And consciousness are like basic elements;$Think of them like the self.$So the six elements have no real self.$$It also says: "Besides giving things labels, what really exists or doesn't exist in the world?"$$This means that in ultimate reality, not even names exist. In everyday reality, things only exist because we give them labels. When you understand this well, you'll see that everything depends on other things, that nothing exists by itself because it all depends on labels and causes, and that when we say something exists, we're just using convenient labels without looking too deeply into what they mean.
The second point is about how we naturally grasp at things as if they exist independently, not just as labels or names we give them. This natural tendency makes us think things exist "truly," "ultimately," "absolutely," or have some kind of "inherent nature" or "intrinsic characteristics." When analyzed carefully, this is what we mean by true existence.$$The Svātantrika Madhyamaka teachers have an interesting approach. They say while nothing can truly or ultimately exist, some things do have their own nature at the conventional level. They teach this way to help people who might find it hard to understand the deeper truth right away.$$According to Aryadeva's Commentary on the Four Hundred Stanzas, what we call a "self" is thinking something exists independently, without depending on other factors. When we realize there's no such independent existence in people, that's called the selflessness of persons. When we realize there's no such existence in things like eyes or noses, that's called the selflessness of phenomena. This shows us that grasping at independent existence - whether in people or things - is what we need to overcome.
When we look at how we naturally view ourselves, the root text says we shouldn't focus on our physical and mental parts, while the autocommentary says we should focus on the self that exists in relation to these parts. This means we should look at the simple sense of "I" or personhood that makes us think "I am." The autocommentary explains that we take this non-existent self, imagine it exists, and believe it's real. So we end up thinking this "I" truly exists.$$The autocommentary also mentions that this view of ourselves involves thoughts of "I" and "mine" through confused wisdom. This means that for this natural self-view to occur, we must spontaneously think "I am." Therefore, while we might naturally grasp at other people as independently existing, this isn't the same as our natural view of ourselves. When the text talks about thoughts of "I" and "mine," it's not just about having these thoughts, but about believing these things exist independently.
When we grasp at things as "mine," what we're really focusing on is just the idea of "mine" itself, not actual things like our eyes. When Candrakīrti wrote about how we think "this is mine" about our eyes and other things, he was explaining how we first see things as belonging to us and then believe this "mine-ness" is real. He wasn't saying that eyes themselves are what we're grasping at. If that were true, there would be no difference between thinking things belong to us and thinking things exist independently.
Here's what we focus on when we naturally grasp at things as being real: we grasp at physical things like our body and other people's bodies, at sense organs like eyes and ears, and at the world around us. We do this in the same way as explained before.$$This habit of seeing both ourselves and things as truly real is what keeps us trapped in the cycle of rebirth. The Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness explains this, saying that when we think things that come from causes and conditions are truly real, that's what the Buddha called ignorance. This ignorance leads to the twelve links of dependent origination.$$To stop this ignorance, we need to see that things aren't the way we think they are. The Seventy Stanzas tells us that when we truly see things are empty, ignorance stops, and then the twelve links also stop. The Praise to the Dharmadhatu adds that as long as we think in terms of "me" and "mine," we'll keep seeing things incorrectly. But when we understand that neither we nor things have any true self-nature, we can break free from rebirth.$$The Four Hundred Stanzas confirms this, saying that when we see objects have no self-nature, we can stop the cycle of rebirth. It explains that when we get rid of confusion, all our mental problems go away. When we understand how everything depends on other things to exist, we won't be confused anymore. That's why we should focus all our effort on understanding this teaching.
This passage discusses delusion as one of the three poisons. The delusion here refers to afflicted ignorance. To overcome this ignorance, one must understand the profound meaning of dependent origination, where emptiness is understood through dependent relationships. The commentator explains that yogis must negate the self, meaning they should realize selflessness by refuting what the mind grasps as self. Simply withdrawing the mind from its object without properly refuting self-grasping isn't enough to understand selflessness. When the mind engages with objects, it does so in three ways: seeing things as truly existent, as lacking true existence, or without qualifying them either way. Just as not seeing something as lacking true existence doesn't mean you see it as truly existent, not engaging with self doesn't automatically mean you understand selflessness. We must identify self-grasping in our own mind and analyze how our perceived self doesn't exist as we imagine it. Looking elsewhere for answers is like searching for a thief's footprints in the wrong place. Understanding true existence helps us recognize many thoughts that aren't self-grasping, preventing misunderstandings about what reasoning about suchness should negate. While there's more to explain, some points have been covered elsewhere or will be addressed later.
The second topic has two main parts: using logic to show how things lack a self-nature, and using logic to show how persons lack a self-nature. The first part breaks down into four sections: disproving production in four ways according to both conventional and ultimate truth, answering objections to this disproof, showing how dependent arising prevents wrong views about extremes, and explaining what we learn from this analysis. The first section has three parts: stating that nothing is produced inherently, proving this with logical arguments, and explaining what we understand after disproving the four types of production.
Here's the first point: Nāgārjuna thought that if he explained just one of the ten equanimities - specifically how things don't truly arise - then the other equanimities would be easier to understand. So in his Treatise on the Middle Way, he began by saying: "Nothing ever arises from itself, from something else, from both, or without a cause - nothing arises anywhere at all." The words "ever" and "at any time" mean the same thing. When he says "anywhere," it's like saying "in any place," and these words tell us about where, when, and in what philosophical system nothing arises.
The text explains how things don't come into being in three different ways. When discussing both outer objects and inner experiences, it starts with the phrase "from self." This means nothing can ever create itself, no matter where you are, when it happens, or what philosophy you follow. The same applies to three other ideas: things can't come from other things, can't come from both self and others, and can't appear without any cause. While the text called Prasannapadā translates this differently, this version works better. Some might think this is like saying saffron won't grow in certain places or crops won't grow in certain seasons, but that's not what it means. According to Madhyamaka philosophy, nothing can truly arise by itself, and this isn't just about what different philosophical schools believe. The Commentary explains that when we say "not," we're talking about how things can't arise from themselves, and this automatically shows they don't truly exist.
Here's what this text is saying: The Madhyamakāloka explains that we can disprove things being produced in four different ways to show nothing has inherent existence. This approach is fine - the issue isn't with that. What's incorrect is breaking down each type of production separately. As Candrakīrti explains in his Prasannapadā, things exist conventionally just because they depend on conditions, not because we accept any of these four ways of production. If we accepted those, we'd have to say things have their own inherent nature. So when philosophers talk about things being produced from "other" things, this isn't how Buddhist scriptures talk. They use this term assuming "other" means something that exists with its own characteristics. In Candrakīrti's tradition, even in everyday conventional reality, things aren't produced from "other" things. While we do say causes and effects are different things conventionally, this isn't the same as saying one is produced from the other. It's like how we say each thing has two aspects conventionally - yes, things have a nature, but not an inherently produced one.
According to Clear Words, when things don't arise from themselves, this is a simple negation. This applies to the other three types of negation too. When proving that things lack inherent existence, we just need to eliminate what we're negating. Clear Words explains this using examples from everyday language, where terms like "nothing exists" are simple negations. The Commentary then shows how to prove these four points through reasoning. Later, it uses the argument that things can't arise in any of four ways to show that nothing has inherent existence. Candrakīrti's Clear Words confirms this after disproving the four types of arising. When Clear Words says that logical proofs only disprove others' claims, it means we're just refuting their belief in inherent existence, not trying to prove anything else. Similarly, when it says we don't prove things exist or don't exist, but just refute others' extreme views to establish the Middle Way, it means we're simply removing these two extreme views without adding new claims.
This isn't just about saying what things aren't - it's about building something positive too. The texts teach us that we find the middle way by clearing away two extreme views. Now, if someone won't accept that things lack intrinsic existence, they must believe things have intrinsic existence, since there's no other option. The Vigrahavyāvartanī makes this clear: if you try to disprove "lack of intrinsic existence" using the concept of "lack of intrinsic existence," you end up proving things have intrinsic existence. I've explained elsewhere why accepting these ideas doesn't make someone a Svātantrika Mādhyamika, so I won't go into that here. About the two types of negation: generally, a negation happens when our mind actively rules something out. Just identifying what something isn't doesn't count as a real negation. Take ideas like ultimate nature and ultimate truth - even though these terms don't explicitly negate anything, when we think about them, they naturally eliminate elaborate conceptual thinking.
There are two types of negation. The first type, nonimplicative negation, is when you rule something out without suggesting anything else in its place. For example, if someone asks a brahman "Is it okay to drink alcohol?", answering "Don't drink alcohol" just rules out drinking alcohol - it doesn't say anything about drinking other things. The second type, implicative negation, is when ruling something out also suggests something else. For example, if you want to show someone is from the commoner's caste and say "He's not a brahman", this not only rules out him being a brahman but also suggests he belongs to a lower caste with less education. These suggestions can happen in three ways: directly, indirectly, or based on context.
Here's a first example: when we say "No-self exists," one statement does two things - it denies something and suggests something else at the same time. The second example is when we say "Stout Dharmadatta doesn't eat during the day" - this indirectly tells us something else. These two examples show different ways of suggesting extra meaning - one direct, one indirect. We can see both types combined when we say "Stout Dharmadatta, who doesn't eat during the day, isn't skinny."
Third, let's look at a situation: imagine we know someone is definitely either from the royal family or a brahmin, but we're not sure which. In this case, we can't simply say "This person is not a brahmin." The Commentary on the Prajñāpradīpa explains this by saying that some negations work by hinting at meaning, some work by using positive words, and some work without directly stating things.$$Some people wrongly think that when you combine a positive statement with a negative one, it can't be a simple negation. But this isn't correct. For example, even though "brahmin" is a positive term, saying "brahmins don't drink alcohol" is still just a simple negative statement. It's like how a sound being obvious doesn't stop its impermanence from being hidden.$$Nāgārjuna's four important points show that nothing can:$1. Come from itself$2. Come from other things$3. Come from both itself and others$4. Come from nothing at all$$If things existed by themselves naturally, they would have to arise in one of these four ways. That's because something either needs a cause or it doesn't, and if it needs a cause, it must come from itself, from something else, or from both. These four possibilities cover everything.
The second main topic has four parts: showing why things can't come from themselves, showing why they can't come from other things, showing why they can't come from both, and showing why they can't appear without any cause. The first of these has two parts: using the Commentary's logic and using Fundamental Wisdom's logic. The first part breaks down into three: examining claims of philosophers who say they understand ultimate reality (Suchness), showing how these ideas don't work even in everyday life, and summarizing what we learned from these arguments. The first of these has two parts: showing why something can't come from a cause that's exactly the same as itself, and showing why a cause and its result can't be exactly the same thing. The first part has three sections: showing why it would be pointless, showing why it doesn't make logical sense, and addressing attempts to defend this idea.
Here's how we know things don't create themselves: Take a sprout for example. If it created itself from its own nature, there would be no point to this because its nature would already exist in its seed. The Sāṃkhyas believe that different causes and conditions work together to create one common result. They say this only works if there's one basic nature running through everything. So they think the nature of a seed is the same as the nature of water, fertilizer and other growing conditions. They say the sprout's nature and its causes' nature are the same thing. While they agree seeds and sprouts are different things, they still think a sprout comes from both its seed and its own nature. Some Sāṃkhyas prefer to say things just become visible rather than saying they arise, but it means the same thing. This is different from how Buddhists understand things. If everything about a sprout already existed in the seed, then the actual sprout would have to be there too, not just its nature. This would make it pointless for it to grow again later.
Here's the second point: Something that already exists cannot come into existence again. When we say "also," we mean this is another problem on top of the pointlessness of things arising from their own nature. Now, if someone argues that things just become visible rather than truly arising, we can respond in two ways: If the visible effect already exists within its cause, that contradicts their own position. If it doesn't exist yet, we need to examine whether the visible effect and its basic nature are the same thing or different things, and then we can disprove their argument.
Here's why we say self-arising doesn't make sense: Think about a seed. If something that already exists could come into existence again, what's stopping a seed from just keeping on becoming itself instead of turning into a sprout? Nothing! This means we'd never see sprouts, stalks, or sheaths in our world. Also, the seed would just keep becoming itself forever until the end of time, because if something that exists has to exist again, it would never stop. This shows us two problems - things can't produce similar things, and causes just keep repeating themselves endlessly. That's why self-arising doesn't work logically.
Here's the third point: Someone might argue like this - "The things that help a sprout grow, like water and springtime, change the seed into something like fermented mash and make the sprout appear. Since a sprout can't exist at the same time as the seed that made it, the seed has to disappear when the sprout appears. This means we avoid two logical problems, and since the seed and sprout aren't really different things at their core, we can say things do come from themselves." But this argument doesn't work. If the seed and sprout are exactly the same thing in every way, how could the sprout make the seed disappear? It couldn't - just like a sprout can't make itself disappear. Even when shown this problem, some stubborn people still argue that "the sprout only makes the seed disappear in terms of how things appear, so it's different from something destroying itself." This is foolish thinking, because if everything is exactly the same at its core, you can't even explain how things appear differently, so the problem remains unsolved.
The second section has three parts: First, showing why it's wrong to say that seeds and sprouts have no differences in their shape and other features. Second, showing why attempts to defend against this problem don't work. Third, showing why it's wrong to say that both would be equally noticed or unnoticed during each of these two stages.
Here's another problem: When a seed grows into a sprout, the sprout looks and acts very differently from the seed. The sprout has its own length, can be green or yellow, tastes sweet or sour, has special powers, and changes as it ripens. But if you say the seed and sprout are exactly the same thing, these differences shouldn't exist. As Candrakīrti points out, this shows your argument doesn't work, because we can clearly see they're different things. When we talk about special powers, we mean things like medicine that cures just by touching the skin, or herbs that let you fly just by holding them. And by ripening, we mean how things change under different conditions - like how Indian gooseberry or long pepper becomes sweet when soaked in milk.
Here's the second point: Someone might argue that a seed changes into a sprout by giving up its "seed state," and since seed and sprout are just different states of the same thing, the seed itself becomes the sprout. But here's the problem: If something has to completely lose its original seed nature to become something else (a sprout), how can you claim that the seed's nature is the same as the sprout's nature? After all, each state has its own unique identity, and you can't separate this identity from what it essentially is. This shows that seed and sprout can't be completely identical in nature. You might think there's no problem because even though seeds and sprouts look different, they're made of the same basic substance. But this argument doesn't work because you can't understand what something is made of without considering how it looks and appears.
Here's the third point. There's a problem with your view. You say a seed and its sprout are basically the same thing. But think about it - when we see a sprout, we can't see the seed anymore. So if they were the same thing, we shouldn't be able to see the sprout either! Or look at it another way - if they're exactly the same thing, then just like we can see the sprout, we should still be able to see the seed too. But we can't. These two problems show why we can't accept that seeds and sprouts are the same thing. Understanding this helps us avoid wrong ideas - like thinking that while things appear different, they're actually all the same at their core, or that something stays exactly the same as it changes from one stage to another.
After showing what's wrong with how the Samkhya system thinks things come from themselves - which is different from what Buddhism teaches - we can see that even regular people who haven't studied philosophy don't believe things can create themselves. This is simple to understand: when a seed dies but we can still see the plant it made, everyone knows the seed and the plant can't be the same thing.
Here's why self-arising doesn't make sense: Whether you look at it from the highest truth or everyday reality, nothing can create itself. This applies to both physical objects and mental phenomena. That's why when Nāgārjuna talked about this, he didn't need to specify which level of truth he was talking about - he simply said things don't create themselves, period. This is why when Bhāviveka wrote "things don't ultimately arise from themselves because they exist (just like conscious beings do)," adding the word "ultimately" wasn't really necessary.
Here's the second point: There are more problems with self-arising. If something produces itself, then the effect and its cause would be the same thing. The action and the one doing the action would also be the same thing. But we know these can't be the same. That's why we shouldn't accept self-arising, as explained in both this text and the Fundamental Wisdom.$$The Fundamental Wisdom explains the first problem: "Cause and effect can never be the same thing. If they were the same, then the producer and what's produced would be identical." This means if cause and effect were the same thing, then a father and son would be the same person, or an eye and eye-consciousness would be identical.$$The second problem comes from Fundamental Wisdom too: "If firewood were the same as fire, then the doer and what's being done would be the same." Even if someone agrees that specific things like father and son have the same nature but argues they're different in general, they still can't escape the logical problem. If things have the same nature, their appearances must also be the same.$$Therefore, anyone who wants to understand the Two Truths correctly should avoid accepting self-arising, because these problems are unavoidable. Since something either arises from itself or it doesn't - there's no middle ground - we must accept that things don't arise from themselves.
This section has two parts: first explaining what others believe, and then showing why they are wrong.
The Buddhist essentialists argue that things cannot arise from themselves (as this would be pointless), nor from both self and other (since self-arising is impossible), and arising without causes is clearly wrong. However, they say we must accept arising from other causes, since Buddhist scriptures teach that four conditions produce things. These four conditions are explained differently by various schools:$$According to the Treasury of Abhidharma, the conditions are:$1. Causal condition (five types of causes excluding active cause)$2. Objective condition (all phenomena that can be perceived)$3. Immediately preceding condition (previous mental states)$4. Dominant condition (the active cause)$$Some schools explain these based on examples: like a seed producing a sprout (causal), an old man using a walking stick (objective), the final moment before something arises (immediately preceding), and necessary circumstances (dominant). Buddhapālita and others discuss these in their works like Clear Words. The Lamp of Wisdom and Sthavira's tradition describe similar ideas using different terms. They all reject Īśvara (a creator god) as a cause, following the Treasury of Abhidharma's teaching that things arise from proper conditions in sequence.
This section breaks down into two main parts: first, we'll look at general arguments against the idea that things come from other things, and second, we'll specifically examine why the Cittamātra school's view doesn't work. The first part has five sections: we'll start by showing why arising from other doesn't make sense, then deal with everyday objections to this view, explain why this understanding is helpful, show that nothing truly comes into being on its own, and finally discuss why it's beneficial to understand this at both conventional and ultimate levels. The first section itself has three parts: a general critique, specific problems, and an analysis using four possible scenarios about results. We'll begin with two points: showing why this leads to impossible conclusions and examining what these conclusions mean.
Here's what the text is saying in simple terms: $$First, things can't come from completely separate, independent things. This goes against both logic and Buddhist scriptures. The Rice Seedling Sutra, for example, clearly states that "sprouts of name-and-form aren't created by themselves or by other things."$$Here's why this makes logical sense: If things could truly come from completely separate things, then darkness could come from fire (which actually removes darkness!). In fact, anything could come from anything else. Why? Because if we say things are completely separate, then there's no difference between things that can cause something and things that can't.$$Let's use an example: Think about a rice seed and the sprout it produces. Those who believe in "arising from other" say the seed is completely separate from the sprout. But if that's true, then the seed is just as separate from the sprout as fire or coal is. So if a sprout can come from a seed because they're separate, it should also be able to come from fire or coal. Similarly, if a sprout can come from a seed, then pots and cloth should also be able to come from seeds.$$This is exactly what the Fundamental Wisdom text talks about when it says causes and effects can't be completely separate - if they were, there would be no difference between things that can cause something and things that can't. The Commentary explains that these impossible conclusions show us why the original idea must be wrong.
The second section contains two parts: first, why we need to show the absurd results of things arising from other sources, and second, why it's okay to accept the opposite of these absurd results.
Here's a simple explanation of why other-production leads to problems. Some Tibetans say it's because causes must come before effects, while things that are different must exist at the same time. This doesn't make sense because their own argument has the same problems they're pointing out in others. If they say they don't actually believe this, then why did they waste time looking for reasons in the first place? Also, many Tibetans talk about how logicians prove things - like how smoke always means there's fire, or how anything that's made must eventually end. They say you can prove these rules by looking at one example, like a kitchen or a pot, and then apply it everywhere else because they're similar. But Candrakīrti shows this leads to problems when you try to use it for things being "different" from each other, because it creates a chain reaction of wrong conclusions.
This shows a lack of understanding of both the text's meaning and logical reasoning. In the Prasannapadā (Clear Words), Candrakīrti explains that we accept conventional reality based only on dependent relationships, not through the four extreme positions. If we accepted those four positions, we'd have to accept that things have inherent nature, which is incorrect. When we accept just dependent relationships, cause and effect are mutually dependent and don't exist inherently. This means things don't appear to have inherent nature. The text explains two key differences: accepting or not accepting self-arising, and the reasons for this based on the four positions. If you accept arising from other, you must accept inherent arising. But if you accept just dependent arising, you don't need to accept inherent arising. Therefore, "other" in "arising from other" doesn't mean just any kind of otherness - it means inherently established otherness. This leads to extreme logical problems if accepted, but accepting mere otherness doesn't cause these problems.
Regarding the second point: Someone might ask how to understand these quotes from Clear Words. The quotes say that only opponents need to accept the reverse of consequences, not us, since we have no thesis. And when Madhyamikas who teach no inherent existence present consequences to those who teach inherent existence, they don't need to accept the reverse meaning. Buddhapālita also mentions this when discussing meaningless re-arising.$$This isn't problematic because these statements only apply when refuting self-arising, not to all Madhyamika consequences. The consequences here aren't just about pointless arising and endless arising - they're specifically about re-arising being pointless and endless. Only the Samkhya school accepts the reverse of these - that re-arising has meaning and limits. Since we Madhyamikas don't hold this position, we don't contradict ourselves.$$The key point is that existence and re-arising are incompatible, but existence and simple arising aren't. Similarly, existence and finite re-arising are incompatible, but existence and finite arising aren't.
The second section has two parts: first, a response to counter the objections, and second, a refutation of that response.
Here's what someone argues: While causes and effects are different from each other in a real way, this doesn't mean that anything can come from anything. We can see that specific causes lead to specific effects. This is because we call something an effect only when it can be produced by a particular cause, so effects are specific. Note that this use of "therefore" goes against what the Commentary says. A cause is something that can produce a specific effect, even though it's different from the effect, so causes are also specific. This means that causes and effects are related through specific differences, not just because they're different in general. For example, a rice sprout only grows from a rice seed that's part of its own sequence, not from barley seeds that belong to a different sequence. Even in the same sequence, things only come from what can produce them - later moments don't create earlier ones, but earlier moments create later ones. So a rice sprout doesn't grow like barley sprouts grow from barley seeds - not everything can come from everything.
Here's a second point: Let's ask those who believe causes and effects exist independently: "Why do rice seeds always produce rice sprouts and nothing else?" They might answer "Because that's what we always see happening." So we ask them back "Why do you always see it happening this way?" When challenged like this, they can only repeat "We see it because we see it." This answer doesn't explain anything and doesn't fix the problem we pointed out earlier.$$The issue is that they haven't explained why things can be completely different from each other yet still have a fixed relationship. Their answer doesn't solve this problem.$$Also, if things are completely different from each other by their very nature - whether they're related as cause and effect or not - this actually goes against what they're trying to prove. For example, barley, lotus flowers, and kiṃśuka flowers are different from rice seeds, so we don't expect them to produce rice sprouts, they can't produce rice sprouts, they're not part of the same process, and they're not similar to previous rice plants. By the same logic, rice seeds would also lack these four connections to rice sprouts because they too would be completely different by nature. This shows you can't establish these four relationships between things that are totally separate from each other.
This topic has two main sections: First, we'll examine how things can't come from other things when looking at causes happening before their effects. Second, we'll look at how things can't come from other things when causes happen at the same time as their effects. The first section breaks down into two parts: the main discussion and how to answer any challenges to our arguments.
First, let's look at how we dealt with our opponent's view. We first discussed their idea that things are naturally different from each other, and then showed why this view doesn't work. Here's how: Think about two people, Maitreya and Upagupta, who exist at the same time - we can say they're different from each other because we can compare them directly. But a seed and its sprout are different - they don't exist at the same time. You can't have a sprout until the seed changes. So how can we say the seed is naturally different from something that doesn't exist yet? We can't. This means we can't say things naturally arise from other things. If the seed were naturally different from the sprout, it would always have to be different, even when it's just a seed. But that would mean the seed and sprout would have to exist at the same time, which we know isn't true. This shows they can't be naturally different from each other. Remember though - we're not saying cause and effect aren't different in everyday terms. We're just focusing on a specific kind of difference here.
Second, someone might object that it's wrong to say sprouts and seeds can't exist at the same time. They argue that just like how a scale's two ends move up and down together, not at different times, the sprout's appearing and the seed's disappearing happen simultaneously. So they say there's no problem since the seed and sprout are different things.$$But this scale example doesn't work. Even if we accept that the scale's up and down movements happen together, seeds and sprouts don't actually exist at the same time. Here's why: something that's just starting to appear (like the sprout) is still in the future and doesn't exist yet in the present. Meanwhile, something that's disappearing (like the seed) exists now but is about to vanish.$$When the sprout is about to appear, the seed exists in the present but the sprout is still in the future. So how can this be like a scale where both ends exist and move together? It can't, because with a scale, both the up and down movements exist in the present moment. But with seeds and sprouts, they're never present together.$$As mentioned in the Rice Seedling Sutra and explained by Candrakīrti, while the sutra uses this scale example, it's not meant to prove things arise from other things or have their own inherent nature. It's just showing how things appear dependently.
Someone might ask: "If this sutra isn't using the up-and-down movement of a scale to show how seeds and sprouts happen at the same time, what kind of simultaneity is it trying to show?" The commentary explains that it's showing how things appear to arise together, like an illusion. While we can't say things exist simultaneously in an ultimate sense, they can appear to happen together in everyday reality. Think of it like this: when a cause ends and its effect begins, these activities can happen together without the actual things being present at the same time. This is fine in everyday reality but becomes problematic if we think things exist ultimately. As Candrakīrti explains in his Clear Words, understanding this difference makes someone a true follower of Madhyamaka philosophy. Those who just argue without understanding aren't worth debating with.
Here's a debate about how things come into being. Someone argues that while a seed and sprout can't arise from each other since they don't exist at the same time, other things that do exist simultaneously could arise from each other. They give the example of eye consciousness and feelings that happen at the same time. They say just like eye consciousness comes from the eye, visible forms, and feelings all working together at once, similarly the eye and mind create feelings and other mental states simultaneously.$$But here's the problem: if eye consciousness is produced by things that exist at the same time as it (like the eye and mental states such as discrimination), then why would it need to arise at all if it already exists? And if you try to fix this by saying the effect doesn't exist when its cause exists, then we've already explained why that doesn't work - things that happen one after another can't be truly different from each other.$$This shows two things: First, even if causes and effects are different things, they can't truly produce each other. Second, causes and effects can arise together but can't be inherently different. So the idea of things arising from other things is just empty words with no real meaning.
Third, let's think about what it means for a cause to create something different from itself. Can it create something that already exists by itself, or something that doesn't exist at all, or something that both exists and doesn't exist, or something that neither exists nor doesn't exist? Let's look at each possibility. First, if something already exists by itself, why would it need anything to create it? It wouldn't - because if something that already exists needed to be created, it would mean creating something twice, which doesn't make sense. And what about creating something that doesn't exist? That's impossible - it would be like trying to create a rabbit's horns. Creating something that both exists and doesn't exist? That's impossible too, because nothing can be both at the same time. And creating something that neither exists nor doesn't exist? That's also impossible, because everything must either exist or not exist.
The second topic breaks down into two parts: First, how to handle everyday objections while temporarily accepting that things can come from other things; and second, how to handle everyday objections by showing that nothing actually comes from other things, even in everyday life. The first part has two sections: what people commonly object to, and how we respond to show these objections don't work.
First, let's address your reasoning about things coming from other things. It's like you had some dry wood covered in butter, and the fire of your understanding burned it all up. You've already used enough reasoning to fuel your wisdom-fire - you don't need to add any more wood to it.$$You might ask, "Don't we need to use reasoning to prove that things come from other things?" Actually, no. When something is already obvious to everyone in the world, we don't need extra reasoning to prove it. What ordinary people see and understand is very powerful evidence. Here's why: Everyone in the world sticks to what they see with their own eyes and believes it to be true. They can directly see that different results come from different causes. When we use logical arguments, we only need them for things that aren't obvious - not for things we can directly see.
First, we can see other-arising directly with our own perception, so we don't need to prove it with logic. So if we can already see other-arising happening, why would we need any other reasoning to prove it exists? Even without other proofs, we can see things arising from other things, so what's the point of showing more reasoning about other-arising? There isn't any point, because we can see it directly with our own perception.
Here's what happens when someone doesn't properly understand scripture: They've been stuck since forever thinking things are truly real, because of old habits in their mind. It's like they're best friends with this wrong idea. They haven't heard enough teachings about how things don't truly exist, which is the way to break free from this friendship. Instead, they just rely on ordinary worldly arguments. To help these people, we can't just jump in - we need to explain how worldly thinking works. We need to show them exactly what worldly thinking can and cannot disprove. To do this properly, we first need to explain the two truths, which involves five steps: explaining what the two truths are in general, showing how they apply here, describing each truth separately, showing why worldly arguments don't work against our position, and explaining how worldly thinking actually works in arguments.
This topic has four main parts: First, it explains how things have two different aspects when we look at them through the lens of the two truths. Second, it presents other ways of understanding the two truths. Third, it explains different types of conventional truth as understood in everyday life. Fourth, it shows that things we mistakenly cling to don't actually exist, even in everyday terms.
First, the Buddhas, who perfectly understand the true nature of the two truths without any confusion, taught that all things - both internal things like mental formations and external things like sprouts - have two aspects to their nature. These two aspects are: their conventional truth nature and their ultimate truth nature. When we examine even a single thing like a sprout, it has these two natures - its conventional nature and its ultimate nature...
Here's a simpler way to understand the second point: While people have different ideas about how to separate the two truths, we'll focus on what can be known. The Meeting of Father and Son Sutra, mentioned in the Training Collection, tells us that the Tathagata understands both everyday truth and ultimate truth. Everything we can know fits into these two categories. The Blessed One sees and understands emptiness perfectly, which is why we call him the All-Knowing One.$$When we say "what can be known," we're talking about the basis for making this split into two truths. Both truths have their own nature, but they're like two sides of the same coin - not exactly the same, but not completely different either. It's like how something being "made" and being "temporary" are different ways of looking at the same thing. The Commentary on the Awakening Mind explains this by saying you can't separate ultimate truth from everyday truth - they're connected, just like how something being made means it won't last forever.
These two truths are connected - one can't exist without the other. They share the same nature, just like how "being made" and "being impermanent" are connected. We can identify each truth separately, as explained earlier when discussing what the two types of valid cognition discover.$$If we try to match this with what Śāntideva says in his Guide to the Bodhisattva Way:$"There are two truths - conventional and ultimate.$The ultimate is beyond the mind's reach;$The mind itself is conventional."$$How do we explain this? The first line shows there are two truths. Then one line talks about ultimate truth, and another about conventional truth. Some people think the second line proves the first line's point about ultimate truth being beyond mind's reach - but that's not what the text means at all.$[...]
In conventional truth, there are both objects and subjects. From a worldly perspective, subjects can be either accurate or distorted. Candrakīrti explains that even false perceptions can be divided into two types. When our senses are working properly and not affected by temporary distortions, they give accurate perceptions. When our senses are impaired, they give distorted perceptions. This distinction is made from a worldly view, not from the Madhyamaka philosophical perspective.$$The same applies to objects - some are perceived accurately and others falsely. What the six senses perceive normally in everyday experience is considered true from a worldly perspective, but not from the perspective of the āryas. Things like reflections in mirrors or mirages are considered false even by ordinary people.$$Sense impairments can be internal (like cataracts or jaundice) or external (like mirrors or echoes). Mental impairments include wrong philosophical views and dreams. This analysis focuses on temporary distortions, not the fundamental ignorance that Buddhism discusses. From the highest perspective of Madhyamaka, both accurate and inaccurate conventional perceptions are equally unreal.
Fourth, let me explain how wrong ideas affect the mind using some examples.$$The tīrthikas, whose minds are clouded by ignorance like being in a deep sleep, follow incorrect beliefs and faulty reasoning. Even ordinary people like shepherds and women naturally understand basic things like how things appear and disappear. But these tīrthikas try to be clever and go beyond this simple understanding. It's like someone climbing a tree who lets go of one branch before grabbing the next - they fall into a pit of wrong views. Because they don't understand the two levels of truth properly, they can't reach liberation.$$What these tīrthikas believe about reality doesn't exist even in the ordinary world. It's like seeing horses in magic shows or faces in mirrors - these things aren't real even in everyday life. For something to exist in the ordinary world, it needs to be proven by valid experience. While these imagined things don't really exist, the way they appear to us is a different matter.$$When we see or hear things now, they seem to exist independently because our minds are affected by ignorance. Whether we're seeing reflections in mirrors or real objects, the basic confusion is the same - just varying in degree. Just like a reflection exists but isn't a real face, things exist but not independently. This applies to all illusions, echoes, and similar phenomena - this is what makes this philosophical system special.
Here's what this means: We can't understand ultimate reality through ordinary thinking. So when we try to disprove that things come from other things, we can't just use everyday logic. Instead, we need to accept how enlightened beings see reality and examine it from the highest perspective. Think of it like this - if someone has an eye disease and sees floating hairs that aren't really there, that doesn't mean they can argue with people who have healthy eyes and don't see these false images. Similarly, the understanding of ordinary people (who are confused by ignorance and don't have pure wisdom) can't invalidate the understanding of those who see things clearly without confusion. So even if ordinary perception seems to show things coming from other things, this doesn't disprove the ultimate truth that they don't. That's why wise and holy beings find it amusing when others try to argue against this.
The third section has two main topics: what conventional truth means and what ultimate truth means. The first topic breaks down into three parts: first, looking at when conventional things are considered true or false, second, how different beings see or don't see conventional reality, and third, how ordinary people and enlightened beings understand conventional and ultimate reality differently. The first part then splits into two: the main idea and a special explanation about mental afflictions.
First, we call it delusion because it stops beings from seeing how things really are. When we don't understand reality (ignorance), we think things exist on their own when they actually don't. This misunderstanding blocks us from seeing the true nature of things - and that's what we mean by conventional truth. This explains what "conventional" means when we say "conventional truth," but it's not trying to define conventional truth in general.
The Laṅkā Sutra explains this idea: Things appear to exist in our everyday world, but when we look deeply, they don't have any real core nature. When we mistakenly think things have a core nature when they don't, that's what we call conventional truth. The word we use for "conventional" also means "hiding" or "concealing," so it acts like a veil that hides the true nature of things.
When we ask what this conceals, it hides the true nature of reality, which is why we call it "conventional" or "concealing." This isn't talking about the accurate conventional truth that's part of the two types of conventional truth (accurate and inaccurate). We shouldn't mix up the conventional truth mentioned in the first line with the conventional truth discussed in the last two lines. The first one refers to how we normally accept things as coming into existence and so on, while the second refers to our mistaken belief that things truly exist.
When we habitually see things as truly real, objects like the color blue seem to exist independently even though they don't. The Buddha taught that while these appearances are false, they are considered "true" from the perspective of ordinary people who haven't realized the deeper truth. He explained this in the sutra mentioned earlier.
When the three types of people look at things, they see some things as made-up and false. We call these things "just conventional" because they aren't true even in everyday reality. For example, people who don't understand reality can see that reflections and echoes are false, but they think things like blue colors, minds, and feelings are real. These people can never see how things truly are. Because of this, both the true nature of things and things that are false even in everyday life cannot be called conventional truths.
Here's what this text means: Naktso's translation of this as "some" works better. Think about reflections - they appear to us but we know they aren't real. When we see a reflection, it looks like a face but we know it's not actually a face - that's what makes it false. When we say these reflections are "empty of true existence," we just mean they aren't really the faces they appear to be. We're not saying they don't exist at all in their own way. So even though a reflection isn't actually the face it shows, it still exists as a real thing in our everyday understanding of the world. That's why we can call it a conventional truth.
Here's what this text is saying: When we talk about reflections not being conventional truths, we're looking at it from the everyday world's perspective. People who understand normal language know that a reflection in a mirror isn't a real face, so in that sense, it's not a conventionally true thing. But this doesn't mean reflections can't be conventional truths in the way the Madhyamaka system describes them. If we said something couldn't be a conventional truth just because it's not truly real in the conventional world, we'd be contradicting basic Madhyamaka teachings. These teachings say nothing exists by its own nature, even in everyday life. When people argue that reflections and similar things (which even ordinary people know aren't real) are just conventional but not conventional truths, they're showing they don't really understand how the two truths work, or how worldly people and Madhyamaka philosophers differently understand what's true and false.
When it's said that the true nature doesn't appear to those who have ignorance, this is talking about minds that are clouded by ignorance. We know this because even āryas who still have some ignorance can directly understand the true nature of reality. While both advanced practitioners (āryas) during their post-meditation and ordinary people's understanding of reality don't see ultimate truth directly because their minds are affected by ignorance and its habits, we must accept that they can still perceive ultimate truth in some way. So when Candrakīrti explains that our everyday reality is established through the confused ignorance that keeps us in cyclic existence, he means that the ignorance that makes us think things truly exist (what we call grasping at the self of persons and phenomena) is part of the twelve links of dependent origination, not a cognitive obscuration.
Here's what this text is saying: When we talk about conventional truth being based on ignorance that grasps at true existence, we're really talking about how we view truth from a certain perspective. We're not saying that everyday things like pots and cloth are created by this mistaken way of thinking. In fact, Candrakīrti teaches that anything created purely by this kind of mistaken thinking can't exist at all, even in everyday life. People often get confused because we use the word "conventional" in two different ways - when we talk about "conventional truth" and when we talk about things "existing conventionally." These sound similar but mean different things, so we need to be careful to tell them apart.
Question: Are things like vases true in the everyday understanding of all people who haven't become fully enlightened, or are there some people who don't see them as true in their everyday understanding? When we look at things like forms and sounds that we normally consider true in everyday reality, there are three groups - the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas - who have moved past basic confusion and see these things like reflections in a mirror. For them, these things are just artificial, not truly real, because they don't believe these things to be truly real. To explain this clearly: there are three types of beings who don't see these things as true - the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas.
Let me explain why this distinction is made. It's not about just any śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, or bodhisattva. What makes them special is that they can directly see how all created things are like reflections - empty of any real nature yet still appearing to exist. Now, since both bodhisattvas up to the seventh level and śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas who are still learning can also do this, the text specifically mentions that the third type has gotten rid of ignorance. This means we're talking about bodhisattvas at the pure levels and śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha arhats - these three groups understand that things aren't truly real.
When we talk about what isn't real, we mean both external things and internal experiences. They aren't real because we no longer think of them as truly existing - this is because the confusion that makes us think things truly exist has been completely cleared away. This shows that neither external things nor internal experiences are truly real from the everyday perspective of these three types of people.
The commentary doesn't prove these things aren't conventional truths - it just proves they aren't truths. Anyone who thinks this proves they aren't conventional truths is being very simple-minded. This is a poor way of explaining things that corrupts Candrakīrti's real meaning by mixing it with their own confused ideas.
The point being made here isn't meant for those three special individuals - instead, it's meant to help people like us understand things from their perspective. People who haven't reached their level still naturally believe things exist inherently, so we can't show them that nothing truly exists in the way they conventionally see things.
If someone tries to prove something different from what we just explained by saying these things are not conventional truths from their point of view, this would make no sense at all. Here's why: to show something is a conventional truth in someone's mind, you first need to show it's false. So it's actually quite funny to use "they don't believe it's real" as a reason here.
To understand something as conventionally true, we first need to see it as false. Here's why: When we talk about "conventional truth" - like when we're discussing vases - we have to look at both our mind and the actual object. We can't say the object itself is true. Instead, we can only say it's "true" from the perspective of our ordinary mind that thinks things exist inherently. Once we understand this, we realize that unless we add this mental perspective qualification, we can't call anything "true" - we have to see it as false.
Second, this system has its own special way of understanding mental afflictions, which is different from how both Upper and Lower Abhidharma texts explain them. Here's what makes it unique: It teaches that there are two ways we mistakenly grasp at things as truly existing - we either grasp at people as truly existing, or we grasp at phenomena as truly existing. As mentioned before, these two types of grasping are what we call the two types of self-grasping.
In two of his commentaries - one on Entering the Middle Way and one on Four Hundred Stanzas - Candrakīrti explains that when we grasp at things as truly existing, this is a type of confused ignorance. Both arhats (whether they're śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas) have gotten rid of this ignorance. The Four Hundred Stanzas commentary also mentions that bodhisattvas who understand that nothing truly comes into existence have also overcome it. So this confused ignorance is basically the opposite of understanding that nothing has a self. This isn't just about lacking understanding or having a different view - it's specifically about wrongly believing that people and things exist in some concrete, independent way.
The Abhidharmikas have a different view on two things: what counts as confused ignorance (when we make things seem more solid than they are), and what counts as identity-clinging (when we think "I" and "mine" are truly real things).
The Abhidharma tradition explains in the ninth chapter of the Treasury of Abhidharma commentary that there are two ways we mistakenly view ourselves. First, we think of ourselves as independent, solid beings - this is called the identity view of "I." Second, we think of our possessions as things controlled by this solid self - this is called the identity view of "mine." This understanding is quite different from other Buddhist traditions.
People naturally tend to think of persons as independently real things, even without studying philosophy. However, people don't naturally think of persons as being completely different from their physical and mental parts unless they've studied philosophical systems. So there are two different extreme views about persons.
Let's say someone believes that people and things exist with their own characteristics. How can we show that thinking this way is both a confused ignorance and two types of self-grasping? When we use logical reasoning to show that people and things don't exist independently, we can prove that this way of thinking is mistaken because it sees things as truly existing when they don't. This proves it's a case of grasping at two kinds of self - both in people and in things. Since this view of true existence directly opposes understanding reality as it is, it counts as ignorance. And because we can show that the wrong view of identity continues as long as this ignorance remains, we can prove it's afflicted ignorance. That's why it's really important to understand this special way of explaining mental afflictions.
The Four Hundred Stanzas explains how mental problems like attachment come from the confusion of thinking things truly exist. It says: "Just like how the body's sensing ability exists throughout the body, confusion exists in all mental problems." The explanation of this verse tells us that confusion means not understanding reality correctly, which leads to wrongly believing things exist in a way they don't.
When we feel attachment or similar emotions, we label things as attractive or unattractive based on our delusion. This happens because delusion makes us see things incorrectly. Since attachment and other feelings depend on this confused way of seeing things, they're really just different forms of delusion. Delusion is the main problem here, and this shows that delusion is really about believing things exist in a way they don't.
When we experience attachment and similar emotions, they always come together with confusion - they never happen separately from confusion. This happens because attachment and similar feelings arise from being confused about reality. When we label things as either attractive or unattractive, this incorrect way of thinking leads to attachment and dislike, but this isn't how attachment and dislike actually work. So when the text says these emotions only work on what confusion imagines, it means that attachment and dislike happen because we wrongly think things are naturally attractive or unattractive.
The delusion-created idea of true existence is not the only thing that serves as an object for attachment and similar states. This is because both types of innate self-grasping have objects that are valid bases, and since attachment and similar states work together with delusion, they share the same objects.
When we engage with things in incorrect ways mentally, we develop desire for some objects and turn away from others with aversion. These become real attachment and aversion. However, just because we see people as independent, solid entities and then feel desire or dislike based on that view - that alone isn't what we mean by attachment and aversion. These two types of attachment and aversion work in different ways.
The phrase "they depend on delusion" explains that when we first have the delusion of thinking things exist with their own characteristics, this leads to attachment and other emotional states.
Here's a comparison using the body faculty: Just like how our five senses need the body to work and can't exist on their own, all our mental problems depend on confusion and can't exist without it. This means that if we get rid of confusion, we automatically get rid of all mental problems. That's why we're taught to respect the teaching that shows how everything depends on other things and doesn't exist by itself - this teaching helps us overcome confusion.
The Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness says that when we think things truly exist, this is the basic confusion that keeps us trapped in the cycle of rebirth. In the Sixty Verses of Reasoning, it says: "If you find something to hold onto, the poisonous snake of negative emotions will catch you. If your mind has nothing to hold onto, it won't catch you." This means that if you find anything to grasp as truly real, negative emotions will trap you like a snake. Right after this, it says: "If your mind has something to hold onto, how can the powerful poison of negative emotions not affect you?" This is what the great teacher Nagarjuna taught.
In his commentary, Candrakīrti explains a passage from Nāgārjuna's Sixty Stanzas. He says that people who see things as really existing can't get rid of their negative emotions, even if they want to. Here's why: when you think things truly exist, you'll definitely experience emotions like desire. If you find something nice, you'll get attached to it and can't easily stop that attachment. If you don't like something, you'll get angry and resentful, and that's hard to stop too. Even with things you feel neutral about, you'll still be confused about their true nature. So as long as you believe things exist on their own, you'll either want them or hate them, and even without these feelings, you'll still be confused about reality.
In the Bodhicaryāvatāra, it says: "When the mind focuses on something, it gets fixed there. If the mind doesn't understand emptiness, it will just keep coming back after it stops - just like what happens in the meditation state where you don't make distinctions." On this topic, Buddhapālita agrees completely with the other two masters about what noble Nāgārjuna really meant.
This teaching explains that you can reach nirvana just by following the path of sixteen aspects (like understanding impermanence), but this needs to be interpreted carefully. When this path talks about mental afflictions, it doesn't give the complete picture. However, this helps us understand things like pride and ego. There are also two types of special mental states we need to understand - both learned and natural forms of ignorance, identity view, and extreme views. I won't write more about this as it would get too long.
Here's what happens on the path of meditation: First, we have wrong ideas about things being truly real. These wrong ideas come in nine different sizes - big, medium, and small. To fix each wrong idea, we use nine different meditation techniques. The same goes for when we wrongly think that the person who knows something and the thing being known are totally separate - again, nine sizes of wrong ideas and nine matching meditation fixes. This teaching is meant as a stepping stone for students who aren't ready yet to fully understand how things lack both obvious and subtle types of self-existence.
Things appear to have a real nature to ordinary people even though they don't, which is why these things fool them. But for the three special types of people we talked about earlier, these things are just temporary arrangements that depend on other things - so they see them as just surface-level appearances, not as truly real things.
Here's what happens: Noble ones who are not in deep meditation can still see things that are colored by ignorance and its habits. This is because they still have a type of ignorance that, while not disturbing, still blocks complete knowledge. However, noble ones in deep meditation, who experience things without appearances, don't see these at all.$$Someone might ask what this system considers to be knowledge blocks. The Madhyamakavatara-bhāsya explains it this way: The habits of ignorance stop us from fully understanding things. The habits of attachment and similar states cause certain physical and verbal behaviors. Only fully enlightened buddhas can completely remove these habits of ignorance and attachment - nobody else can. For example, even arhats might still jump around like monkeys or call people "commoners" - these are physical and verbal habits that continue even after the Buddha told them to stop.
The word "also" shows us that our habitual patterns of attachment and other disturbing emotions block us from clearly understanding what we can know. These habitual patterns from our disturbing emotions create veils over our knowledge, and all the confused ways we see things as separate or dual that come from these patterns are included in these veils.
There are two kinds of mental habits: ones that come from disturbing emotions and ones that don't. The second type creates barriers to gaining complete knowledge. Even when someone has completely removed all seeds of disturbing emotions and no longer sees things as truly existing, their mind still makes mistakes about what it sees because of these leftover habits.
Since noble beings who haven't become buddhas still have the ignorance that blocks complete knowledge, they switch between two states: when they're meditating deeply, they experience no appearances, but after meditation, they have thoughts with appearances. The buddhas, however, have directly understood both the ultimate and everyday nature of everything, so all their conceptual thinking has completely stopped. This means they don't switch between states with and without appearances during and after meditation.
The word "permanent" shows that for noble ones (āryas), their deep meditation state doesn't last forever - it comes and goes. This means they switch back and forth between being in deep meditation and regular awareness. When we say they still have confusion about knowledge, this isn't to explain why they see things, but rather to explain why they sometimes see things and sometimes don't, depending on whether they're in meditation or not.
The way our mind and thoughts work is through making concepts. The text Clear Words explains this by saying that making concepts is how the mind moves around. Since ultimate reality (suchness) doesn't have any concepts, it's completely free from mental activity. A sacred text adds: "What is ultimate truth? It's a state where the mind doesn't move at all - so why even talk about using words to describe it?"
Here's the third point: When ordinary people think something is ultimately real, noble ones who can see things clearly understand it's just conventionally real. For these noble ones, the empty nature of things is what's ultimately real. To explain the first part: When ordinary people believe things like vases are ultimately real, the three types of noble ones (who we talked about before) see these same things as just conventionally real when they're experiencing normal perception after meditation. This means that while these things aren't absolutely true for noble ones, they are still conventionally true. However, it's impossible for the imagined "ultimately real things" that ordinary people believe in to become conventionally real for noble ones.
The later text explains that what ordinary people see as normal dependent things, the noble ones (āryas) see as ultimate reality. So it's wrong to say that something like a vase is both ordinary for regular people and ultimate for noble ones - this goes against what the text says. Anyone who claims this doesn't understand that if something is seen as conventional truth from one perspective, it must be proven false from that same viewpoint.
For the buddhas, what is most real is the natural way things are. Since this never misleads us, it is the highest truth, and this is something that each buddha realizes for themselves.
The word "itself" is used to specifically exclude something. What it excludes is the way other noble beings experience ultimate truth - where they experience no appearances during meditation and have appearances after meditation. Instead, this refers to the ultimate reality that always stays in perfect meditation on the true nature of things.
This text explains that ultimate truth doesn't truly exist on its own. Instead, truth means something that doesn't deceive us when we see things as they really are.
Here's how we explain ultimate truth, according to important Buddhist texts like Clear Words by Candrakīrti (who was explaining Nāgārjuna's teachings). Think of someone who has an eye problem - they see things that aren't really there, like floating hairs. Even if someone with perfect vision tells them "there are no floating hairs," they can't see (or not-see) exactly like the person with good vision. But this doesn't mean they can't understand the basic idea that the hairs aren't real.$$It's the same with understanding ultimate truth or suchness. While we might not see it exactly like someone who is completely free from ignorance, we can still understand it through teachings and explanations. So when Buddhist texts say ultimate truth is "beyond words and concepts," they don't mean we can't learn about it at all - they just mean we might not experience it exactly like someone who has direct insight.
Someone with an eye disease looks into their drinking cup made of rhinoceros horn and sees hairs and flies that aren't really there. Thinking these are real, they keep turning and shaking the cup trying to get rid of them.
When someone with good eyesight goes to where another person sees floating specks, they can look exactly where the other person points but won't see any specks or think about what these specks might be like. When someone who sees these floating specks tells someone with normal vision "I see floating specks," the person with normal vision wants to help correct their misunderstanding and might say "There aren't any floating specks here." But when they say this, they're not saying that floating specks don't exist at all.
When someone with an eye disease sees floating hairs, what those hairs really are is what a person with healthy eyes sees, not what the person with the eye disease sees. Think about these two examples and understand their meaning in this way: When people's minds are affected by the eye disease of ignorance and they haven't seen the true reality, they perceive things like the physical parts of beings, basic elements, and sense organs in a certain way. This perception is just a conventional reality, like the floating hairs seen by someone with an eye disease.
When people don't truly understand what the aggregates are, they see things in a distorted way. The buddhas, who are completely free from confusion and mental habits of ignorance, see these same things differently - just like someone with perfect eyesight doesn't see imaginary floating hairs. What the buddhas see when they look at the true nature of the aggregates is what we call ultimate truth.
Here's the argument: If buddhas can't see everyday things (like our body parts) that appear to confused minds - just like someone with perfect eyesight can't see floating hairs that aren't really there - then these everyday things wouldn't exist at all. Why? Because if these things really existed, buddhas would definitely be able to see them.
Someone might say: "Without things like the physical parts that make up our everyday world, no one could become a buddha, because when people first decide to seek enlightenment, they're still confused about reality." Here's why this isn't a problem: A buddha's wisdom works in two ways - it understands the ultimate nature of things, and it understands how things appear in everyday life. The first way means seeing the true nature of things like our physical parts without getting caught up in how they appear to ordinary people.
Second point: A buddha must directly perceive things to know them - they can't just figure things out indirectly. So when a buddha's wisdom knows all phenomena, both the knower and what is known appear clearly as separate things.
Although buddhas see things clearly without being affected by confusion and mental habits that make us see things like body and mind as real, they can still see how confused beings perceive things. They must be able to see these everyday appearances because these appearances do exist at a conventional level, and buddhas must be aware of everything that exists.
Even though someone with clear vision doesn't see the floating hairs that someone with blurry vision sees, this doesn't mean those appearances don't exist. This is different from how things are for a buddha.
Until we completely clear away our habit of seeing things as separate from ourselves, we can't directly see both the ultimate nature and the variety of things at the same time. We have to switch back and forth between seeing these during meditation and after meditation. This means we can't see both in a single moment of wisdom. But once we've completely removed all confused habits, both types of wisdom naturally arise together in each moment without stopping. Then we don't need to alternate between seeing these two aspects anymore. This explains why it's correct to say "Even in a single moment of wisdom, all knowable things are completely understood."
The Buddha has a special ability: he can have two types of wisdom that are basically the same thing but work differently when looking at different objects. Some people wrongly say that the Buddha only knows ultimate truth and doesn't have knowledge of all different things in his own mind, claiming this knowledge only exists in the minds of students. Others go even further and say the Buddha doesn't have either type of wisdom in his mind. We'll talk more about this later in the section about the final result.
Someone asks: "If all dual appearances have disappeared, doesn't that mean such a nature can't be seen at all? So how do the Buddhas see ultimate truth?" Here's the answer: While it's true that Buddhas don't see things in a dual way when they perceive reality directly, they do see by way of not-seeing. This makes sense because: first, their wisdom directly sees the true nature of things like the aggregates; second, the fact that these things don't exist from that viewpoint is their true nature; and third, they must therefore see this nature by not-seeing things. As the Auto-commentary explains: "They directly know pure nature without touching manufactured things - that's why we call them Buddhas." This means the same as saying their wisdom sees reality by not-seeing things.
Here's what "Not seeing is the highest seeing" really means: It's not saying that being unable to see anything counts as seeing. Instead, as mentioned before, when we talk about "not seeing," we mean not seeing mental complications, which helps us see the uncomplicated truth. So "seeing" and "not seeing" are talking about different things. The Condensed Perfection of Wisdom explains this with an example: "When you don't see physical forms, feelings, thoughts, intentions, consciousness, mind, or mental activity - that's when you're really seeing truth," says the Tathāgata. "It's like when people say they can see space - think about it, how do they actually see space? That's exactly how seeing truth works," the Tathāgata teaches. "There's no better way to explain it." So the things we don't see are the five aggregates, and what we do see is reality itself - that's what we call suchness. It's just like the saying "Anyone who sees dependent origination sees reality."
Think of space - it's just the absence of solid things you can touch. When we say we see or understand space, we're really noticing that there's nothing blocking or obstructing it - if there were something blocking it, we'd be able to see that. So in this example, we see the space but don't see any obstructions. The final line tells us that seeing the true nature of reality isn't like seeing something blue - it works differently.
To show how the Buddha understands reality by not trying to grasp it, the Entering the Two Truths explains: "Dear divine child, if ultimate truth could be experienced through our body, speech, or mind, it wouldn't actually be ultimate truth anymore - it would just be conventional truth."
Dear divine one, when we talk about the deepest level of reality, the ultimate truth goes beyond all our normal ways of describing things. It has no divisions, was never born, never ends, and can't be talked about or known in our usual way. The sūtra teaches us that when someone sees ultimate truth, it's not that they stop seeing normal things like the parts that make up our experience. Instead, if ultimate truth became something we could experience with our body, speech, or mind (like we experience normal things), it wouldn't be ultimate truth anymore - it would just be another ordinary experience. This helps us understand why seeing ultimate truth is described as a kind of "not-seeing."
The second sutra explains that when you directly experience ultimate reality, ultimate truth appears as one unified whole without different parts or features. The other three points are straightforward to grasp.
From that perspective, being free from verbal activities is easy.
When wisdom directly sees the true nature of reality, it understands ultimate truth as its object. But in that state of wisdom itself, there's no separation between the knower and what is known. This is because the idea of subject and object only exists in our ordinary way of thinking. It's like when we use logical reasoning to understand ultimate truth - even though we can say the reasoning mind is the subject and ultimate truth is the object, this division doesn't exist in the actual understanding itself. Dear celestial child, ultimate truth, which has all the highest qualities, is beyond even what the all-knowing wisdom can grasp as an object. It's not something we can simply point to and say "this is ultimate truth."
All things are false and misleading. Here's what this means: When we say something is ultimately true, our mind naturally splits it into a subject and an object - the knower and what's known. But the Buddha's all-knowing wisdom sees things differently. From that perfect viewpoint, all these split appearances are false and misleading. In the direct experience of reality (suchness), things like the aggregates don't even appear. When someone directly sees reality, there's no room for concepts like "exists" or "doesn't exist" because these ideas aren't found there. Therefore, only enlightened beings (āryas) can directly understand reality - ordinary people cannot. This means that ordinary worldly understanding can't disprove what the āryas say about things not arising from other things.
Here's the fourth point: Some people might object to our rejection of things ultimately arising from other sources by using everyday examples. If we accepted that ordinary people's perceptions were valid when examining the true nature of reality (suchness), then regular people would directly see reality themselves. Since this would have been happening since the beginning of time, we'd have to say they've already overcome ignorance. So why would we need āryas to realize reality? What's the point of following the ārya paths? But it doesn't make sense to consider confused ordinary people as reliable sources about reality. Therefore, since ordinary perception isn't valid at all when examining reality, everyday objections don't work when discussing the true nature of things. Some people criticize this system while others praise it, both thinking it rejects all valid ways of knowing. They're just expressing their own views without understanding what this master really meant - they misunderstood his point about ordinary perception not being valid for understanding reality as meaning he rejected all valid knowledge.
As the text Clear Words explains, we need to reject the idea that valid knowledge and what we can know exist on their own. Instead, we should understand them as things that depend on each other. This will be explained more later.
Fifth, someone might ask "How can everyday common sense prove something wrong?" Here's how: If you try to deny something that everyone knows to be true using everyday logic, people will prove you wrong using common sense. Here's an example: Someone says "My thing was stolen." Another person asks "What thing?" They answer "A vase." Then the second person argues "A vase can't be a thing because it can be measured, just like a vase in a dream." In cases like this, common sense proves them wrong. However, when wise people study ultimate reality based on what the āryas have seen of ultimate truth, common sense can't prove them wrong.
The text tells us that wise people should look at other similar examples. Here's what it means: Someone might say "I don't own the vase and Devadatta isn't a thief." Or when someone says something grew in their field and you ask them what grew, they say "a sprout." Then others argue "sprouts can't really grow because they're just things we can observe" and compare it to people and plants in dreams. But this shows how everyday common sense proves wrong those who think these are great Madhyamaka philosophical arguments.
Second point: We first accepted the idea of things arising from other sources just to match everyday understanding, and dealt with common objections. Now we'll explain why there's no conflict with common understanding when someone wants to deny that things arise from other sources, because even in everyday experience, we don't actually see things arising from other sources.
Why do people say "I made this son" when talking about someone who is male? Even though they say this, it's not like the father actually takes a male person out of his body and puts him into the mother's womb. Instead, what really happens is that only an impure substance that becomes the seed of the son's body is placed into the mother's womb.
When a father puts his seed into making his son's body and then recognizes him as his son, everyone can clearly see that the seed and the son aren't really separate things. This is why people don't think of the impure seed and the son, or a barley seed and its sprout, as completely separate things that come from each other.
Think about this: If things were completely separate from each other by their very nature, you couldn't point to someone's child and say "I made this." It's like when you plant a tree - you put a tiny seed in the ground, and when a big tree grows, you say "I planted this tree." This shows us that in our everyday world, things don't come from completely separate sources. Even though a seed isn't the same as the tree it becomes, and even though a child isn't the same as what created it, we can still point to them and say "I made this." It's just like how when your hand is hurt or gets better, we say you are hurt or better, even though your hand isn't exactly you.
In everyday life, things don't truly come from other things. However, we can't disprove this just by looking at how things appear in the world. To understand why causes and effects aren't truly separate things, we need to use special reasoning that examines suchness. So when other philosophers say things come from other things, they mean things arise from what exists by its own characteristics, not just that things are different from each other. And this basic difference between things is something everyone can see in everyday life.
The phrase "nothing comes from something else, even in everyday life" doesn't just mean that regular people don't think of causes (like seeds) and their effects (like sprouts) as completely separate things. It actually teaches us that even in our normal everyday world, things don't truly come from other things. The Commentary explains this when discussing why things can't come from both self and other. It says: "We showed earlier that things can't come from themselves or from other things - this is true both in everyday life and at the deepest level. The same logic shows why it's impossible for things to come from both."
The text Clear Words says: Someone asked "If nothing can come from itself, from others, from both, or from no cause at all, why did the Buddha teach that 'ignorance causes mental formations'?" The answer was: "This teaching is about how things appear in everyday life, not about the deepest truth." So this shows that ignorance causing mental formations is only true in everyday reality, not in ultimate reality.
Someone asked "How do we explain how things work in everyday reality?" The answer was that things exist simply because certain conditions come together - we don't need to accept any of the four complicated philosophical theories about existence. This clearly shows that while we accept that things arise because of conditions in everyday reality, we don't accept any of the four theories about how things come into being. So when some people say "this philosophy doesn't reject the idea that things come from other things in everyday reality," they're showing they don't really understand this system of thought.
Here's the third point: We explained earlier that things don't exist by themselves. This shows us how to avoid two extreme views - thinking things last forever or thinking things completely disappear. Here's how it works: Think about a seed and the plant that grows from it. If the plant were completely different from its seed, they couldn't be cause and effect. This would mean that when the plant exists, the seed must be totally gone - like it never existed. The plant and seed would have no connection, so even having the plant wouldn't keep the seed's family line going. It's like this: having a non-cow around doesn't stop a cow's family line from ending when it dies. Similarly, just because ordinary people exist, it doesn't stop enlightened beings (āryas) from breaking free from the cycle of rebirth.
When we say a sprout comes from a seed, they aren't completely separate things. They can still be cause and effect. So when the sprout appears and the seed is gone, this actually helps us avoid the extreme view of annihilationism.
The Commentary tells us that when a sprout grows, the seed that made it stops existing. When we say the seed stops existing, we mean that it no longer continues as a seed. The text also tells us that seeds don't just stay unchanged forever. So when we talk about the seed's continuum ending, we really mean that its family line has ended.
A seed and its sprout cannot be the same thing. The seed doesn't turn into the sprout. So when we see a sprout, the seed must have already disappeared - it can't still be there. This means we can't say the seed exists forever, which proves things aren't permanent. The Lalitavistara explains this nicely: "When you have a seed, you get a sprout. But the seed isn't the same as the sprout, and it's not completely different either - that's just how things work, neither lasting forever nor disappearing completely." This means that while sprouts come from seeds, they're not exactly the same thing or totally different things. The sutra also talks about how our actions and ignorance work the same way - they're empty of any fixed nature and don't really move or change on their own.
This explains that things don't exist on their own, which means the same as saying they don't truly exist in reality. The text called Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way also explains this idea: "When something comes from depending on something else, it isn't exactly the same as what it came from, but it's not completely different either. This is why things are neither permanent nor completely gone."
The fourth section has two main points: First, we'll disprove the idea that things exist with their own characteristics. Second, we'll answer any objections to this disproof. The first point breaks down into three parts: We'll show how this wrong view would mean that when noble ones (āryas) meditate, they would destroy things. We'll show how it would wrongly mean that everyday reality could stand up to logical analysis. And we'll show how it would fail to disprove things truly coming into existence. On the first point, as Candrakīrti said, "We must definitely accept that nothing whatsoever comes into existence by its own nature." So we should definitely accept this point, and not argue against it by saying we shouldn't take this position.
Here's what this means: Imagine if things like forms and feelings had their own built-in nature that came from causes and conditions. When a yogi sees directly that things are empty of any built-in nature, they would have to completely deny that these things exist at all. Why? Because during meditative equipoise, the yogi doesn't perceive forms and such things. If these things truly had their own nature, they should be visible during meditation - but they're not. This would mean these things don't exist at all during meditation. It would be like they existed before meditation but were destroyed during it. This would make meditation itself act like a hammer that breaks a pot - it would destroy the very nature of things. But this doesn't make sense. Therefore, things don't have their own fixed nature, and we should never think they naturally exist by themselves at any time.
Here's what some Madhyamika philosophers argue: They say things can have their own characteristics without being truly real. They reason that if physical forms and other things had their own characteristics, someone who directly sees ultimate reality (suchness) wouldn't need to perceive them. But this argument doesn't work - as we've explained before and will show again, having characteristics like this actually does mean something is truly real, and they can't escape this problem.
In the Commentary, there is a quote from the Ratnakūṭa Sūtra where Kāśyapa is told that when we look carefully at things using the Middle Way, we find that emptiness isn't something that makes things empty - things are already empty by themselves. The text says similar things about other qualities like being without marks, without wishes, without conditions, without birth, and without coming into being. This means that if things had their own built-in nature, they wouldn't be naturally empty, and it wouldn't make sense to say "things are empty by themselves." If we didn't deny that things have their own nature, we'd have to say they're empty of something else - but this goes against the teaching that emptiness doesn't make things empty. So when we examine things using the Middle Way, we see that nothing has its own independent nature.
This teaching explains that the Cittamātra school was wrong about two things: they said that dependent things must exist in their own right, and they said these things are empty only because subject and object aren't really separate. The Four Hundred Stanzas explains this by saying you shouldn't see things as either empty or non-empty, and if you think "I want to get nirvana for myself," the Tathāgatas taught that such wrong views won't lead to freedom from suffering. The Fundamental Wisdom also makes this point, saying that while the Buddha taught emptiness helps free us from all views, anyone who turns emptiness itself into a view can't be helped.
Here's what this text means: When we say things are empty, we mean they lack their own independent nature. Some people say that when a pot is empty of being truly real but still exists as a pot, that's "other-emptiness." They also say that when a pot is completely empty of being a pot, that's "self-emptiness." This is wrong thinking. Why? Because if a pot were completely empty of being a pot, then there would be no pot at all. If something doesn't exist as itself, it can't exist at all - which means nothing would exist, including the person making these claims! This makes it impossible to even talk about what is empty and what isn't. Some people think this kind of complete emptiness is the right view, while others say it leads to nothing existing at all. Both these views go against what Nagarjuna and Aryadeva taught many times - that things exist in a middle way, depending on other things, avoiding both extreme views that things either exist forever or don't exist at all.
Some people say that all conventional truths must be proven empty of themselves, and they think this means everything is completely non-existent. This is wrong. None of the four Buddhist schools would accept or teach such a view that everything is non-existent. Here's why: While both types of emptiness show that things are empty of what we're trying to disprove, the emptiness that shows things don't have their own characteristics is the real meaning of being empty of inherent existence. Other types of emptiness are different because once you understand the first type through valid reasoning and keep that understanding, you can't develop wrong ideas about things truly existing. But with other types of emptiness, even when you understand them properly, you might still develop wrong ideas about things truly existing.
Someone raises this question: "You say nothing truly arises in ultimate reality, so you reject things arising from themselves or from other things. But look at physical forms and feelings - we can prove these exist through our two ways of knowing things. These must come from other things. If you don't agree with this, why do you talk about two levels of truth? You'd only have one truth. So clearly," they say, "things do arise from other things."
These people who argue seem to believe two things: that nothing truly arises in ultimate reality, but that things can arise from other things in everyday reality. This makes them Svātantrika-Mādhyamikas.
Someone argues that if we don't accept that things can truly arise from other things in our everyday world, we'd end up with only one level of truth instead of two. This means that if nothing truly arises even in our everyday experience, we couldn't have conventional truth at all. This would leave us with only ultimate truth. The response is: Yes, that's true, but from the highest perspective, there aren't two truths anyway. As taught to the monks: "There is only one ultimate truth - nirvana, which never deceives."
It is said that "Everything that is made up of parts is false and misleading." This means that since truth by definition must be something that doesn't mislead us, only ultimate truth, which never misleads, can be considered truly true. So it is acknowledged, "Yes, this point is true."
When we talk about "ultimate perspective," we mean how someone who sees the true nature of reality views things. From this viewpoint, there aren't two separate truths (conventional and ultimate) - there's only ultimate truth. The highest truth is what we call ultimate truth. We know that conventional truth doesn't exist from this wise perspective because it's taught to be deceptive in nature.
Here's what this means: If things existed with their own built-in nature, then we couldn't say that created things are false and misleading. This would mean there's no such thing as conventional truth, which would eliminate the idea of having two kinds of truth. But if we say things don't have their own built-in nature, then we can have both conventional and ultimate truth.
Someone might ask: "The scripture we discussed earlier says only nirvana is real and everything else is false. So even though normal things aren't real in themselves, doesn't this mean nirvana, being the ultimate truth, must be real in itself?" But that's not what the sutra means - when it talks about truth, it just means nirvana doesn't deceive us, not that it exists on its own.
Since we are taught that all conditioned things are false and misleading by nature, we can understand that the earlier mention of truth means something that doesn't mislead us.
The Commentary on Sixty Stanzas tells us something interesting: Regular things in our world appear in a way that fools ordinary people. Nirvana, on the other hand, appears in its ultimate form but doesn't fool anyone. That's why they say nirvana is true and everything else is false. So we should definitely understand that when we talk about true and false, we're really talking about what deceives us and what doesn't.
In Candrakīrti's Commentary on the Sixty Stanzas, he says nirvana is true in our everyday understanding. He means that nirvana, which is ultimately true, can be understood from our everyday perspective - not that it's true in the ordinary sense. Since our everyday understanding helps us reach the ultimate truth, the Mādhyamika accepts things as they appear in daily life without questioning whether things come from themselves or others, just like everyone else does.
When we look at things like physical forms and feelings to see if they come from themselves or from something else, we find that in the deepest reality (called suchness), nothing actually appears or disappears. So we shouldn't try to analyze everyday reality by asking if things come from themselves or others. Instead, we should just accept how things appear in the world, simply noting that "when this exists, that happens." As Āryadeva explained, just like you can't communicate with foreigners without using their language, you can't understand the world without using its everyday terms. The Fundamental Wisdom teaches that you need to use everyday language to understand the deeper truth, and without understanding this deeper truth, you can't reach nirvana. And Averting the Objections says we can't explain anything without using everyday terms.
Here, when we talk about analyzing or not analyzing something, we're talking about whether we examine the true nature of reality (suchness) or not. It's important to know exactly when our examination becomes a true analysis of suchness. Let me explain briefly: In the Prāsaṅgika tradition, when we're not satisfied with just accepting everyday labels like "a sprout grows," and we start asking whether the thing we're labeling grows from itself or from something else - that's when we're analyzing suchness. This is completely different from ordinary questions we ask in daily life, like "where are you coming from?" or "where are you going?" or "is it inside or outside?"
The Svātantrika Madhyamaka philosophers have a different approach to analyzing reality. They don't just jump straight into examining ultimate truth. Instead, they first look at whether things exist simply because we perceive them, or whether things exist independently on their own. This difference in how they identify what needs to be examined leads to two different starting points for analyzing ultimate truth. Some people misunderstand this and use the example of Devadatta - like when we wrongly think he has arrived somewhere when he hasn't, and only realize our mistake after checking. These people incorrectly conclude that everything we haven't analyzed must be wrong, while everything we have analyzed must be right. But this isn't what either Madhyamaka or Buddhist logic schools teach - both systems actually accept many things as valid even before detailed analysis. I've explained this more elsewhere, so I won't go into detail here.
If you use logical analysis meant for investigating ultimate reality to examine everyday things, you should know that this will break down all ordinary ways of talking about the world.
Third point: When we remove all our beliefs about things being truly real, some people get nervous and say "But we must have some truly existing things with real characteristics that cause bondage and enlightenment!" To such people, I say you're just left with empty words.
Here's why: When we analyze ultimate reality (suchness), our previous reasoning showed that things like physical forms can't logically arise from themselves or from other things. The same logic applies even in everyday reality - it just doesn't make sense. So how could anyone prove that things arise with their own inherent nature? They can't. Therefore, even if we don't like it, we must accept that nothing arises with its own inherent characteristics in either ultimate or conventional reality. When we talk about what this reasoning disproves, even on a conventional level, we're specifically talking about things arising with their own substantial nature, as explained in the connection section and summarized earlier. So when we say "arising through inherent characteristics," we're only talking about what we're trying to disprove - not about arising in general. After all, we've been told many times that we shouldn't apply ultimate analysis to conventional things.
Here's what Candrakīrti is saying: If our logical analysis of reality can't disprove conventional existence that has its own characteristics, then it also can't disprove ultimate existence. Why? Because as soon as we say something exists by its own characteristics, we're already talking about true existence - whether we call it "conventional" or not doesn't matter. We find many different ways of describing what we're trying to disprove in the Buddhist sutras, in Nāgārjuna's writings and his son's works, and in Candrakīrti's texts. They use phrases like "existing by its own characteristics," "existing by its own nature," and "existing by its own essence." When arguing against these ideas, some Mādhyamikas become the target of criticism. The Prasannapadā explains that we must accept this view, because otherwise conventional reality would become truly real, making it ultimate rather than conventional. This criticism is aimed at philosophers who reject ultimate existence but accept conventional existence - clearly pointing to the Svātantrika Mādhyamikas, not the realists.
Here's what Master Candrakīrti says: Some people claim that when Nāgārjuna wrote "Not from self, not from other," he was only rejecting the idea that subject and object are different things (the imputed nature), but wasn't rejecting that dependent nature truly exists. However, since these people can't prove their interpretation with any evidence, we need to thoroughly question and examine their claims. Some early scholars say this opposing view came from Master Sthiramati and others, but we can't actually find these statements in their writings.
According to Dharmapāla's explanation in his commentary on the Four Hundred Stanzas, he understood its philosophical view to be Cittamātra, so this interpretation makes sense.
Someone might ask: "How do scholars who follow Cittamātra explain what Nāgārjuna meant in his writings?" While great teachers like Vasubandhu don't directly tell us their interpretation of Nāgārjuna's works, we can see in texts like Rules of Exposition that they use the Unraveling the Intent Sutra to explain that the Perfection of Wisdom sutras shouldn't be taken literally. This suggests they would explain Nāgārjuna's works the same way. After all, they wouldn't disagree with Nāgārjuna's teachings, but they also wouldn't take his words literally since they don't take the Perfection of Wisdom sutras literally. If they say the literal meaning needs interpretation, they must interpret it according to Cittamātra philosophy.
Here's the simple explanation: When we look at teachings that say nothing exists ultimately or has its own independent nature, we can prove these statements are meant to be taken literally through logical reasoning. Since there's nothing wrong with taking them literally, Candrakīrti says we should just examine and study them as they are. He gives many reasons why we shouldn't interpret these differently and shows lots of proof for taking them literally. This proves that Nāgārjuna's texts mean exactly what they say and can't be interpreted any other way. That's why he only briefly mentions this point here.
Someone objects: "If nothing truly exists by its own nature in either ultimate or conventional reality, then physical forms wouldn't exist at all. This means we wouldn't see any physical objects with our eyes in everyday life. If you say otherwise, then we might as well see rabbit horns with our eyes too, since the logic would be the same!"$$Here's the response: We do see things like reflections in mirrors and hear echoes in caves, even though they're empty of true existence. These appear when the right causes come together - like a mirror and a face, or a cave and a sound. Everyone knows this happens in everyday life. Just as these empty appearances like reflections can create visual consciousness that perceives them, so too can other phenomena.
Here's how Candrakīrti explains it: Think of how looking at a reflection creates a false image in your mind. Similarly, even though nothing exists independently, things that lack independent existence can still produce effects that also lack independent existence. When we look at a reflection, our eyes perceive it as real. A reflection is actually a thing that exists separately from our awareness of it - it's out there in the world and gives our eyes something to see, making it a visible object. The same idea applies to other illusions like seeing double moons, floating hairs, mirages, or hearing echoes. When our senses are confused, these false appearances work just like when our normal, healthy senses perceive things as having independent existence.
Just like how a reflection of a face seems real but can't actually exist as a real face, things appear to have their own independent existence but actually can't exist that way.
Reflections and echoes are like forms and sounds. While the five sense objects (like form) aren't considered external things in terms of their basic nature, we can still think of how they appear as being external. In the same way, while reflections aren't considered to be real faces, we can still think of the reflections themselves as external things. So both cases work the same way when it comes to what we consider external and what we don't.
When ordinary elderly people who haven't studied any teachings about emptiness look at a reflection, they can easily tell it's not a real face. This basic understanding doesn't count as a type of rational knowledge, and it's wrong to think that it does.
Someone might ask: "Okay, we all know reflections are fake, but that's not the same as what Madhyamaka means by 'false.' So how can we use reflections as an example?" Here's the answer: When we use examples like reflections, we're using things that ordinary people already understand as false. We're not trying to use examples that only make sense after studying Madhyamaka philosophy.
Think about how a reflection looks like a real face. You can't point to one part and say "this part looks like a face" and another part and say "this doesn't look like a face" - the whole thing appears as a face. Even though it doesn't actually exist the way it looks, it still comes from causes, like a mirror and light. The same goes for when we see something blue. When it appears to exist on its own, you can't separate parts that seem to exist independently from parts that don't - it all appears that way. Just like the reflection, even though it doesn't exist exactly as it appears, it can still come from causes and create effects. If you can understand how a face reflection exists (even though it's not exactly what it appears to be), you can understand how blue things exist (even though they don't exist independently like they appear to).
When we look carefully at things like physical forms, we need to be clear about what we're saying doesn't exist and what we do accept exists. We can understand this using the example of reflections. This understanding is absolutely necessary to grasp the Middle Way view - we shouldn't be satisfied with a shallow understanding. In his Commentary, Candrakīrti explains that even though reflections have no real existence, they still work as causes and effects. So what wise person would think that things like physical forms and feelings must have real existence just because we can perceive them? Even though we can see these things, they don't have inherent existence. This shows the difference between simply existing and having inherent existence. Buddhapālita and Candrakīrti, in explaining Nāgārjuna's teachings, showed how things can exist without having inherent existence, avoiding both extreme views. As Candrakīrti explains in his Commentary on the Four Hundred Stanzas, if we don't understand this difference, we'll either think things must fully exist or not exist at all - like a donkey's horns. That's why it's so important to understand these two different types of existence and non-existence.
Here's what the Meeting of Father and Son Sutra teaches us about reflections: When you look into a perfectly clean mirror, you see reflections that have no real existence of their own. In the same way, you should understand that trees and all phenomena are like these reflections. You can apply this same understanding to other examples of illusions that were mentioned before.
The fifth topic has two parts: first, how it helps us avoid extreme views of things being either permanent or non-existent, and second, how it helps us better understand how actions lead to results. Let's look at the first part. Everything is like a reflection in a mirror - nothing exists in an inherent way. This applies both to ultimate reality and everyday reality. This means that things like physical forms aren't permanently fixed, but they don't completely disappear either. When we talk about things disappearing, it's like how a seed changes when it becomes a sprout. As Nāgārjuna explains in Fundamental Wisdom, if we say "something that existed before is now gone," we're falling into the trap of thinking things completely disappear. If we believe things exist inherently and then say they either last forever or completely disappear, we're stuck with extreme views either way.
In the Commentary, Candrakīrti quotes from Nāgārjuna's Fundamental Wisdom, explaining that when the Buddha creates a magical copy of himself, and that copy creates another copy, it's similar to how actions, the people doing them, and their results work. This shows that things without any built-in reality can come from other things that also don't have any built-in reality. This proves we're not saying nothing exists - we're just saying that things exist while not having any built-in reality.
If we don't reject the idea that things exist with their own characteristics in our everyday world, we won't understand the deepest meaning of selflessness. This makes it hard to stop very subtle wrong views about things being either permanent or completely non-existent from appearing in our minds. The benefit of rejecting this wrong understanding in our everyday world is that we can completely get rid of these incorrect views. When we reject this kind of existence in our everyday world, we not only avoid wrong views about ultimate reality, but we also stay free from confused thinking about everyday reality. This makes it much easier to let go of wrong views about permanence and non-existence.
This section has three main parts. First, it shows that if you don't believe things exist inherently, you don't need concepts like foundation consciousness. Second, it gives examples of how results can come from past actions. Third, it answers objections to these ideas. The first part breaks down into three smaller sections: explaining how this connects to previous topics, explaining the main text's meaning, and discussing related points. Here's the connecting explanation: When you understand that nothing has inherent existence - whether in everyday life or ultimate reality - you not only avoid extreme views like "everything is permanent" or "nothing exists," but you can also explain how karma works without needing complicated ideas like foundation consciousness, mental continuum, non-destruction, or obtainment. This shows two benefits: you avoid extreme views and can explain karma simply.
In commenting on the noble texts, while nothing exists with its own inherent nature, there is a special way of explaining things that still lets us talk about how everything works. This unique approach leads to several special philosophical ideas that other commentators don't share. What are these ideas? The main ones are: that there's a foundation consciousness separate from the six types of consciousness; a special way of showing why self-awareness doesn't exist; rejecting the use of certain logical arguments to convince others about ultimate reality; accepting both mind and external objects as equally real; accepting that hearers and solitary realizers understand that things lack inherent existence; considering the belief in inherently existing things as a mental problem; accepting that when things end, that ending is real; and because of this, having a special way of understanding past, present and future. The first point is explained here, and how rejecting self-awareness relates to rejecting inherent existence will be explained later.
I have already given a detailed explanation elsewhere about how we reject autonomous syllogism and what this means for intrinsic existence. I'll also give a short explanation here.
Let me explain how this connects to accepting external reality. Here's how the fifth point relates: When Buddhapālita looked at the śrāvaka texts that say "nothing has a self," he explained that this means nothing exists independently by its own nature. We accept this view too. This shows us the full meaning of selflessness. So when we talk about people having no self, we mean that no person exists independently by their own nature. The key thing to understand is that to really get this, you also need to understand how all things lack a self. This means we have to say that thinking things exist independently is definitely a mental problem or affliction. This creates several important differences in understanding: there are two ways to classify mental afflictions (subtle and obvious ones), different views on whether understanding impermanence and similar concepts is enough for liberation, and different ideas about when we overcome obstacles to knowledge.
Both Madhyamaka schools accept that someone who first entered the Mahayana and properly established the view of suchness could later fall into the śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha paths. Such a person would directly realize the selflessness of phenomena through meditation and continue cultivating what they've seen. On the path of seeing, they would eliminate conceptual grasping at the self of phenomena, and on the path of meditation, they would eliminate innate self-grasping. This raises a question: Does the Madhyamaka system, which accepts that things exist through their own characteristics, recognize two types of grasping at phenomenal self-existence - one afflictive and one non-afflictive? While this isn't explicitly explained, the Svatantrika position must maintain that practitioners on the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha paths can temporarily eliminate manifest grasping at phenomenal self-existence, but without accumulating limitless merit, they cannot eliminate the seeds of either type of self-grasping. Therefore, while śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas might temporarily eliminate manifest cognitive obscurations, they cannot eliminate their seeds.
According to Candrakīrti, when we grasp at things as if they truly exist, this is a mental affliction. So we don't need to gather endless good deeds to remove the seeds of this affliction. But when it comes to clearing away our habit of seeing things as separate from our mind - which blocks our knowledge - we can't do this without gathering such good deeds. I'm explaining this because understanding these differences is really important.
Someone asks: "If we say nothing exists by its own nature, how can karma and its effects work without accepting foundation consciousness? Here's the answer: All Buddhist schools agree that good and bad actions can produce happiness and suffering as their results, even after a very long time has passed. But here's the problem - if the karma had to stick around until it produces its result, it would have to be permanent. And since permanent things can't actually do anything, this would make the whole relationship between karma and its results impossible."
Here's what happens when a karmic action ends right after you do it: there's nothing there between that moment and when the result shows up. Since both the action and its ending don't exist anymore, how can it create any results? Some teachers answer this by saying there's a foundation consciousness that stores the action's power just before it disappears. Others say there's something called noncorrosion, which works like a receipt for a debt - it's not physical or mental, but it keeps track of what's going to happen.
Some people think that when we talk about obtaining two types of karma, this is something separate from the two karmas themselves - it's a different kind of mental factor that isn't directly connected to either of them.
Some people think that our stream of consciousness carries the marks of our past actions. They say this explains how karma can produce results much later, even after the original action is gone. They believe karma leaves its mark in our basic consciousness, and these marks are what karma produces. These marks continue in a chain until they finally create results - so the original karma's effects come through this chain. We should understand the other three views in the same way. The first view comes from some Cittamātra teachers. According to Avalokitavrata, the second view belongs to the Vaibhāṣikas, but not the Kashmiri Vaibhāṣikas. The third also comes from a branch of the Vaibhāṣikas. While we're not told clearly who holds the fourth view, when we look at chapter nine of Vasubandhu's Abhidharmakosha-bhāsya, it seems to be what the Sautrāntikas and Kashmiri Vaibhāṣikas believe.
The Kashmiri Vaibhāṣikas believe in obtainment, but they don't think that obtainment comes from two things - the thing being obtained and obtainment itself. But in this case, we're talking about someone who does believe this - that's what the phrase "according to whom" means.
The Prāsaṅgika Mādhyamika teachers explain that since actions don't naturally exist on their own, their results can come from actions that haven't really stopped existing. This means we don't need to believe in a foundation consciousness to explain how actions lead to results. For example, even when someone does two actions and these actions stop, and even after many thousands of years pass, the results of these actions will definitely happen exactly as they should. This shows that the connection between actions and their results makes perfect sense in this way of thinking. The four scholars who answered this question all believed that actions start and stop by their own nature, and that once an action is done, its ending exists by itself.
This master shouldn't try to defend his position by saying "We accept the foundation consciousness and similar concepts, so there's no problem with how things cease." This argument doesn't work because nothing truly arises or ceases in an inherent way.
To show that this is how Nāgārjuna would explain it, he quotes: "Karma doesn't really come into being because it has no inherent existence. And since it never really came into being, it can't really disappear either." This means that karma doesn't exist on its own, so it can't arise by itself. Therefore, since karma can't naturally disappear either, it doesn't make sense to think that after you do something, that action continues to exist on its own without disappearing.
This logical reasoning, while explained for refuting noncorrosion, works just as well for refuting the other three things too, because the reasoning behind it is exactly the same.
From the sutra we learn: "People are said to live for a hundred years. But even though we say this, you can't actually pile up these years into something real. The same goes for achievements. When we talk about things never ending or karma running out - in terms of ultimate reality (emptiness) nothing really ends, but in everyday terms we can talk about things ending." This shows us that things don't truly end or stop by themselves - we just talk about ending and stopping as practical ways of describing things.
According to Naktso's translation: "Think of how years cannot be physically piled up into a heap - in the same way, you should look at how things come together." This helps explain that things don't naturally stop existing on their own.
The third topic has two main points: First, we'll explain why the fact that things don't naturally stop existing is a reason to reject the idea of foundation consciousness. Second, we'll show how we can still have a basis for habits even without accepting foundation consciousness. Let's look at the first point: Someone might argue that even though things don't naturally stop existing, we do say that actions stop in some cases. As our texts say, "things stop but don't naturally exist" and "this only applies to everyday terms." So after an action happens, we have to accept it stops. At this point, since stopping isn't a real thing, and we don't accept foundation consciousness as the basis for how actions connect to their results, you might wonder how effects can appear long after actions stop. But there's no problem here - because the very fact that things don't naturally stop existing explains how later effects can come from stopped actions. That's why no other explanation was needed.
Here's the main idea: People who believe things exist on their own say that when something stops existing, that stopping can't be a real thing. But the Madhyamaka view, which says things don't exist on their own, believes that stopping can be a real thing. Let's look at the first view: When a sprout dies, all its parts are gone, and you don't get anything else like a pot in its place. So they say the stopping isn't a real thing - because you can't point to it like you can point to something blue or a pot made of parts. The second view uses an example: Take Upagupta - you can't say he's just his five parts, or all his parts together, or something separate from his parts. But even though Upagupta isn't exactly any of these things, we can still call him a real thing based on these parts. Similarly, even though you can't point to stopping as either the thing that stopped or something like it, it's still real because it depends on what stopped existing.
To prove this point, Candrakīrti uses two types of evidence in his text Clear Words: quotes from scripture and logical reasoning. He first quotes from the Ten Grounds Sutra, which says "Birth leads to aging and death." When something dies, it means that being has ended, and the text says this ending happens because of birth. The same text also explains that death does two things: it makes things fall apart and it keeps ignorance going without stopping. So death both has causes that make it happen and creates effects like ignorance. This means that when something ends, it can be caused by something else and can also cause other things to happen. This is true both for long-term changes (like the death of a being) and quick changes (like one moment changing to the next). The first moment actually causes its own ending when the second moment comes. So whether we're talking about beings being born and dying, or moments not lasting, they're the same in terms of being real things and being caused by other things.
Looking at this teaching, the Fundamental Wisdom says that things that exist and things that don't exist are both created by causes and conditions. The Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning adds that when causes run out, there is peace, and this is what we call "exhaustion." For example, when a sprout exists or doesn't exist, both states are caused by conditions. Just like when oil (the cause) runs out, it makes the lamp flame (the effect) go out too. We should definitely understand this as what Nāgārjuna meant to teach.
When something stops existing in the first moment and moves to the second moment, we need to understand this by ruling out what we're denying. It's a type of denial, but not the kind that just says "no" - it's the kind that suggests something else in its place. This is because when we deny something's existence, we're not just saying it's gone; we're also pointing to something new that's there. For more detailed proofs, you should look at the commentary on Fundamental Wisdom. This is one of those subtle but really important points in Candrakīrti's way of thinking.
Here's the second point: Even if we don't believe in foundation consciousness, we still need to accept that good and bad actions leave impressions in our mind, and these impressions eventually ripen to produce results. We can see this in the Commentary on Entering the Middle Way, which tells us that "people see things as real because of impressions that have built up since the beginning of time." There are many other texts that say similar things.
We need a foundation to store our mental habits, so what exactly is this foundation? Some Buddhist scholars believe in something called the "foundation consciousness." They say this foundation consciousness is what the afflicted mind uses to think "I am," and that it stores all our mental habits. Our system has a different view - we say that the natural thought of "I am" itself is where mental habits are stored.
Someone asks about a statement in the Commentary on Entering the Middle Way that says our mental stream is where habits are stored. Here's the explanation: What we call "I" is just a label we put on our mind and consciousness - that's what we mean by mental stream. If we think about it as a series of similar mental states following one after another, this becomes the place where occasional habits get stored.
Here's how the lingering effects of ignorance work, according to the Commentary on Entering the Middle Way: When something leaves a lasting impression on your mind, affects how you think, and influences your future behavior - that's what we call a habitual pattern. Whether you call it the final stage of mental problems, a habit, a root cause, or an ingrained tendency - they all mean the same thing. Even when spiritual practitioners like śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas overcome their mental problems through advanced meditation, they still can't get rid of these deep-seated patterns. It's like how a jar or piece of cloth still keeps a faint smell of oil or flowers even after you've cleaned them out completely.
Here's how habitual patterns work, whether good or bad. When someone reaches the uninterrupted path of the path of seeing, they've gotten rid of certain things they needed to abandon, but some deeper habits still remain to be cleared through the path of meditation. At this point, their mental consciousness is pure and free from confused dual appearances. This raises a question - where do these remaining habits live? They can't be in the pure mind itself, can't be in the senses, can't be in physical form, and we don't believe in foundation consciousness. The answer is simple - they exist in what we call the mere "I". This same principle works for everything we need to abandon and their antidotes. When you understand how this system uniquely defines what a person is, you can see why advanced practitioners (āryas) born in the realms of infinite space, infinite consciousness, and nothingness don't lose their identity even when their minds reach a completely pure state.
When a holy person born in the highest realm shows signs of having a pure mind that belongs to the realm of Nothingness, they can no longer belong to either the highest realm or the realm of Nothingness, because their pure mind can't exist in either of these places or in nirvana. This argument doesn't actually go against our view, because we can talk about these realms without having to define them by either pure or impure minds. Our opponents say that for beginners and students on the path, their realm-nature is neutral and unclouded. I'm not really qualified to explain these complex systems on my own, but I'm sharing what I've learned from the great teachers who really understood Nāgārjuna's ideas correctly. Looking at all this, it seems the other arguments about foundation consciousness don't contradict our system either. Smart and sharp-minded people should look into this further.
Here's the second point: Think about a dream where you see a beautiful woman. Even after you wake up, if you're not very wise, you might still feel strong desire for her even though she's not really there anymore. In the same way, karma can produce results even after it has ended and even though it never truly existed in the first place. This shows how the results of actions can come from actions that have already ended.
To prove this point, the Sūtra on the Transference of Existence tells a story: "Great King, here's what it's like. Imagine a man has a dream where he's with a beautiful local woman. After he wakes up, he keeps thinking about this beautiful woman from his dream. Great King, what's your opinion on this? Do you think someone who dreams about being with a beautiful woman and then keeps thinking about her after waking up is being smart?" The king answered, "No, Blessed One. And here's why: Blessed One, since the dream woman isn't real and can't actually be found anywhere, how could anyone really be with her? A person who thinks like this will just end up feeling sad and frustrated." This story serves as an example.
Great king, here's what happens: When ordinary people who haven't studied much look at things with their eyes, they get attached to things that make them feel good. This attachment turns into desire. Once they're full of desire, they do things with their body, speech, and mind that come from wanting things, getting angry, and being confused.
After you do an action, it stops existing. When it stops, it's not found in the east or any other direction. This means that people who haven't studied properly won't understand the true nature of things, even if they hear teachings about it.
Strong attachment means believing things truly exist.
When we act because of attachment, those actions can be either good or bad. When we act because of hatred, those actions are always bad. When we act because of confusion, those actions can also be either good or bad.
When we do something, it stops existing right away - this is how things work in everyday life. The rest of the text explains that things don't actually stop existing by themselves. Later, when someone is about to die and their life-sustaining energy is running out, just as they're about to lose consciousness, their mind focuses on particular actions from their past. It's like when someone wakes up from a dream and immediately thinks about a beautiful woman they saw in that dream. When the energy that keeps their current life going runs out and their final moment of awareness ends, their mind naturally turns toward the effects that will shape their next life - similar to how someone might think about a dream-woman right after waking up, though it's not exactly remembering.
As Candrakīrti explains: When a person's final consciousness at death stops and their first consciousness of their next life begins, they might be reborn among the gods or among the hungry ghosts. The final consciousness that stops refers to the consciousness of this current life.
When talking about how consciousness first appears at birth, the text mentions "among celestial beings" as an example. The intermediate state isn't counted as one of the six realms, so we're really talking about consciousness at actual birth. While there is a state between death and birth, many texts don't mention it because they mainly focus on explaining how karma works in terms of death and birth. After this first consciousness ends, a new stream of mind begins that matches what karma results you'll experience.
Great king, nothing moves from this world to the next world, but we can still see death and birth happening. Great king, when the last moment of consciousness stops, we call that death. When the first moment of consciousness starts, we call that birth.
Dear Great King, when our last consciousness stops working, it doesn't go anywhere at all.
When consciousness appears, it doesn't come from anywhere. Why is this? Because it has no inherent nature of its own.
Dear Great King, your final state of awareness has no inherent final awareness in it. The process of death and moving between lives has no inherent death and movement in it.
Karma is devoid of any inherent karma.
The first type of consciousness is empty of the first type of consciousness.
When we talk about birth, it's naturally empty - but this doesn't mean our actions disappear without effect. When we take a new life, we experience good or bad results from our previous actions. The mind that experiences these results comes from the first moment of consciousness at birth. While we can talk about death and rebirth in everyday terms, they don't ultimately exist on their own. This is because nothing has its own independent existence. This same principle applies to how our final consciousness and other things are empty of any self-nature. The Buddha taught that our actions never go to waste, to make sure people didn't misunderstand and think actions and their results don't exist at all.
This topic has two parts: First, we'll answer those who say karma would create endless effects. Second, we'll address those who say our view goes against teachings about the foundation consciousness. $$Let's look at the first part. Someone might say: "If actions don't truly exist but still create effects, wouldn't those effects keep creating more effects forever?" Here's the answer: Think about someone with bad eyes - they might see floating hairs that aren't really there, but they don't see other unreal things like donkey horns or a barren woman's son. Similarly, while no actions truly exist, only unripened actions create effects - once an action has produced its effect, it won't produce more effects.
This example shows two things: first, that actions definitely lead to results, and second, that good and bad actions each lead to their own specific type of result - either pleasant or unpleasant. Think of someone with blurry vision - they might see floating hairs that aren't really there, but they won't see impossible things like horns on a donkey. Similarly, pleasant results can't come from bad actions, and unpleasant results can't come from good actions. This means that unpleasant results only come from negative actions.
One can see that good actions lead to pleasant results.
People who understand that good and bad actions don't truly exist on their own and see that nothing exists independently will break free from the cycle of rebirth. The Buddha saw that regular people try to figure out exactly how specific actions lead to specific results through logical analysis. He worried they might end up rejecting the idea that actions have consequences, which would damage our everyday understanding of reality. So he declared that how actions produce their results is beyond our ability to comprehend, and advised against analyzing it too deeply.
This text uses many different ways to help people be sure about the law of karma, since people might lose their understanding of it. Know this, and use the view of emptiness to make your understanding even stronger. Then work hard to make sure your visit to the island of precious gems is worthwhile.
This topic has three parts: First, how to explain apparent contradictions in sacred texts. Second, whether the foundation consciousness is different from regular mind consciousness. Third, examples of teachings that had special meanings.$$Let's look at the first part: Some people might ask - if we can explain karma and its results without needing foundation consciousness, then why did the Buddha teach about it in texts like the Lankāvatāra Sūtra, Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, and Mahāyāna Abhidharma Sūtra? These texts clearly describe foundation consciousness as the source of everything, like waves coming from an ocean. Should we just ignore these teachings?$$The answer is no. The Buddha taught about foundation consciousness because some students needed to hear it that way. In our tradition, we understand that when the Buddha talked about foundation consciousness, he was really talking about emptiness - the fact that nothing exists independently.
The alaya consciousness is taught this way because it naturally extends into all things.
The Buddha teaches two things: that foundation consciousness exists, and that persons exist in a real way. He does this to help guide people who need this teaching. He once said: "Monks, the five aggregates are like a burden, and the person is the one who carries this burden." When people who believed that persons exist independently asked him questions, instead of telling them persons don't exist, he taught that there is a person who carries the burden. Even though he didn't use the word "substantial," that's what he meant.
Also, for some students, he taught that there is no real solid person - just parts that make us up. He said that whether you call it mind, mental faculty, or consciousness, when it has been filled with good qualities like faith and good behavior for a long time, it will move upward and go to better realms in the next life.
When people believe that the path to higher realms and enlightenment truly exists, they wonder how much of this they should accept. The Buddha taught them about just the aggregates, without challenging their belief in true existence. By doing this, he was indirectly showing that the aggregates truly exist. All these teachings were given with specific purposes in mind.
Someone might ask: "Who was this teaching meant for?" The answer is that it was meant for those who believe in foundation consciousness and think persons truly exist.
This teaching says that only these aggregates truly exist. It was meant for students who are not yet ready to understand the deep meaning that was explained before.
Some students have spent a long time following non-Buddhist beliefs, making it hard for them to understand deep spiritual truths. The Precious Garland says that when people hear "There is no self and never will be, there is nothing that belongs to a self and never will be," they get scared. When these beginners first learn about the true nature of reality, they get frightened and think Buddha's teachings are dangerous, like standing at the edge of a cliff. They turn away and won't learn more, so they can't make real progress. That's why, instead of teaching the deepest truths right away, we first teach them about foundation consciousness and how the parts of our experience are real. This helps them move away from non-Buddhist ideas and achieve important goals. Later, when they really understand the Buddhist texts, they naturally let go of beliefs about foundation consciousness and similar ideas. So this teaching method only helps and doesn't cause any problems.
Keeping this order in mind, the Four Hundred Stanzas says: "Start with whatever interests someone the most. Someone who has lost their way cannot be a proper student of the holy teachings."
When teaching people about the foundation consciousness being different from the six collections of consciousness, we need to explain that external things don't exist. These students are then ready to understand just the basic truth that subject and object aren't separate things.
If you don't accept the foundation consciousness that was explained before, you won't be able to understand how karma and its results work together. That's why it's said you won't understand the deepest meaning.
Here's the second point. In many texts, including the Hundred Thousand Perfection of Wisdom, when they list different types of consciousness, they only mention six types and nothing more. Many Buddhist texts either include or don't include the foundation consciousness in their teachings. Following this pattern, when Maitreya explained these texts, he took two different approaches. In the Middle and Extremes, Ornament of Sutras, and Differentiation of Phenomena, he accepted foundation consciousness and said external objects don't exist. But in the Ornament of Realizations and Sublime Continuum, he didn't mention foundation consciousness and didn't deny external objects.
The famous teacher Asanga did not explain the Sublime Continuum text as a Mind-Only text, but instead explained it as a Middle Way text. In his Commentary on the Sublime Continuum, he quotes a passage from Abhidharma that he had previously used in his Summary of the Great Vehicle to prove the existence of base consciousness. This quote says: "Even though living beings have the Buddha nature as their core, they don't realize they have it."
Here's what was said: "Since the very beginning, there has been a basic element that contains all things. Because this element exists, all living beings can reach nirvana." This quote is used to show that all beings have the natural ability to reach enlightenment. This matches how the master Candrakīrti explains that when Buddha taught about foundation consciousness, he really meant to teach about emptiness. So he believes that Buddha taught about foundation consciousness (as something separate from the six types of consciousness) only as a temporary teaching for certain students who needed it.
Someone asks: In the Commentary on the Awakening Mind, there's a passage about foundation consciousness maintaining existence. It says that just like iron moves quickly near a magnet without having a mind but appearing to have one, similarly the foundation consciousness isn't real but appears real when it moves back and forth, maintaining existence. Like a tree in the ocean moves without having a mind, foundation consciousness moves depending on the body.$$How should we understand this teaching? This was taught to help beginners who might be scared of the teaching that everything is empty. It explains mind-only philosophy without rejecting the inherent existence of mind, but this isn't the final truth. When the Yogācāras' view that purified mind exists inherently is rejected, some might worry that if mind isn't real, how can beings move between past and future lives? The text answers this by showing that just like iron and wood can move without minds, foundation consciousness can appear to move between lives even though it isn't truly real.
Someone might say: "We don't claim the foundation consciousness exists inherently, but we do accept it as something different from the six types of consciousness - like an illusion that holds the seeds of both pure and impure things." Here's the problem with that view: If you accept this kind of foundation consciousness, you'd have to say that things like forms and sounds only appear because of stored impressions in the foundation consciousness, and that external objects don't exist. But as Nāgārjuna teaches: "Consciousness knows objects, and without objects, there's no consciousness - so why not admit that neither the knower nor the known exists?" This shows that outer objects and inner consciousness must either both exist or both not exist. This matches what Candrakīrti says in "Entering the Middle Way" about objects and consciousness being equally real or unreal at both conventional and ultimate levels. So Nāgārjuna doesn't accept a foundation consciousness separate from mental consciousness. When he talks about "foundation," he means either mind in general (as something that's aware and clear) or specifically mental consciousness, because mental consciousness is what takes rebirth and serves as the basis for both pure and impure states.
In the text "Essence of the Middle Way," the idea of foundation consciousness is rejected when taken literally. And since Master Jñānagarbha believes in the existence of outer objects, he also doesn't accept foundation consciousness.
Among Buddhist scholars who follow Cittamātra and reject that things exist outside the mind, some accept the idea of foundation consciousness while others don't. Kamalaśīla, who didn't believe things exist outside the mind, taught that only mental consciousness can link one life to another. He quoted from the Treasury of Abhidharma which says that only mental consciousness handles things like cutting off and connecting between lives, becoming free from attachments, declining, dying, and being reborn. This shows that the great teacher Śāntarakṣita also didn't accept foundation consciousness. Abhayākaragupta thought the same way.
In other Mahayana texts, you'll find mentions of foundation consciousness, but these texts don't really explain what this term means - they just use the name. When you look deeper into what they're actually talking about, you can see they're not saying it's anything different from the six types of consciousness. Since this approach seems to accept that external things are real, they're just using "foundation consciousness" as another name for mental consciousness. I could explain all this in much more detail, but I didn't want to make this too long.
Third point: The Buddha first taught about foundation consciousness to help guide students. Even though the Buddha himself was completely free from seeing things in terms of "I" and "mine," he still used these words when teaching. He did this to help ordinary people understand his teachings. In the same way, even though nothing truly exists by itself, he taught that things do exist by themselves. This was just a temporary teaching to help people gradually understand the true nature of reality.
Here's what this means in simple terms: When the Buddha uses words like "I" and "mine" in his teachings, it might look like he's thinking in terms of self and ownership. But actually, the deeper truth is that he doesn't think this way at all. It's the same with how he teaches about things existing - while it might seem like he's saying things truly exist on their own, the real meaning is that they don't exist that way at all.
Here's how the Buddha taught in ways that ordinary people could understand, according to verses from the Pūrvaśaila tradition:$$If spiritual teachers didn't explain things in ways regular people can understand, no one would be able to know what a Buddha is or understand Buddhist teachings.$$Even though they know that all parts of experience (like our body, senses, and mind) are basically the same, they still talk about three different levels of existence - this helps people understand.$$They teach concepts that can't really be named by using everyday words that people can relate to.$$While showing that nothing truly exists and staying in the Buddha's enlightened state, they still teach that everything exists in its own way.$$Though they don't see things as true or false, they teach about finding peace and the deepest truth.$$Even though nothing is ever really created or destroyed, and everything is equal in the ultimate reality, they still teach about how worlds end in fire.$$Although they can't find any real essence of beings in past, present or future, they still teach about living beings and their world.
These verses teach two things: The last verse shows how living beings have no fixed self-nature (which means persons have no permanent self), while the other verses show how all things and non-things have no fixed nature (which means phenomena have no permanent self). According to a text called the Blaze of Reasoning, the Eastern Mountain School broke away from the Great Assembly School. This shows that the Hearers' teachings clearly explain how things have no fixed nature.
Here's how we specifically argue against the Cittamātra view. We do this in three ways: First, we show why consciousness can't exist by itself without external things. Second, we examine why their proof about dependent nature doesn't work. Third, we explain that when Buddha talked about "mind-only," he wasn't actually denying external objects. Let's start with the first point. The Cittamātra followers couldn't accept what the Madhyamaka school said earlier. They thought this wasn't what Buddha meant, so they came up with their own interpretation. They say that when a bodhisattva reaches the sixth level and practices the perfection of wisdom, they understand reality in a special way - not as separate subject and object, but just as consciousness itself.
Because we can't find any physical objects outside our mind, we come to understand that both our mind and our thoughts are just things that exist because other things make them exist - they don't point to anything real outside. This is what we mean when we say someone understands the true nature of "mind only."
Someone asks: "How does a bodhisattva come to understand the true nature of reality?" Here's how: First, the bodhisattva understands that what we see and experience comes from our inner mental habits. They realize there aren't really any objects separate from the mind, and without such objects, there can't be a separate observer either. They come to see that all three realms of existence are just consciousness. By practicing with this understanding of non-separation for a long time, they directly experience through their own awareness something that can't be put into words - the reality where subject and object are not two different things. This is how bodhisattvas at the sixth level come to understand reality as just consciousness.
Someone asks: "If everything is just mind without any real external objects, how can thoughts appear that seem to show external things when there aren't any?" Here's the answer: Think of an ocean with waves. When wind stirs up the previously calm ocean that was like it was sleeping, waves start moving around. Similarly, we have something called foundation consciousness that contains seeds of everything inside and outside our mind. When mental states like attachment and faith stop, they leave impressions in this foundation consciousness. When these impressions ripen, they create what we call dependent consciousness. Regular people think this creates a split between a perceiver and things being perceived, like there's an inside and outside world. But actually, there's nothing at all that exists separately from consciousness itself.
Here's an example: People who believe in Īśvara as a creator say that just like cows make more cows, crystals create water, and tree trunks make branches grow, Īśvara creates all living beings. In the same way, those who believe in foundation consciousness say it holds the seeds of everything because it's the basis for all things that consciousness can perceive.
Here's the difference: Ishvara is eternal, but the foundation consciousness is not permanent. This is why people who have gotten used to non-Buddhist views over many past lives can be guided to understanding through learning about foundation consciousness.
Here's a question about the Cittamātra view: When we read the Commentary, it often says "there's no external reality" and adds the phrase "separate from consciousness" when talking about objects not existing. So should we always add this "separate from consciousness" part when talking about Cittamātra ideas, or should we just say forms and sense organs don't exist at all?$$The Commentary uses both ways of talking, but we should probably always add the qualification, just like we do with other topics. Important texts like the Mahāyānasaṃgraha explain that the foundation consciousness causes our physical senses and supports our body. It talks about two kinds of seeds - ones that create the world around us and ones that create our personal senses.$$The Commentary on Dependent Origination also explains how form comes from the foundation consciousness, and mentions that while form doesn't exist in the formless realm, it does exist in other realms. This shows that Cittamātra actually accepts physical form in some way.$$If they didn't accept form at all, they couldn't even talk about basic things like shapes and sounds. No Buddhist scholar in India has ever said their system is good while admitting it can't handle everyday descriptions of the world.
The term "proponents of internal objects of knowledge" refers to those who say that things we can know about - like physical forms and sounds - exist as part of our consciousness rather than as external things.
Here's what's happening: The Cittamātra philosophers say they accept things like physical forms and sounds. But they also say these things aren't external objects. This seems contradictory because these forms and sounds appear to us as external things. It's similar to how the Madhyamaka philosophers handle things - they say nothing has inherent existence, but they still accept that things exist in some way. Both schools face a tough problem. For the Cittamātra, if they reject external objects, they'd have to reject physical forms too. But if they accept physical forms, they'd need to accept external objects. This is a complex issue, but I won't go into more detail to keep things brief.
The scriptures have already explained this system. Based on that explanation, we must accept that the dependent nature has a real intrinsic essence. This is because it acts as the foundation for all our conceptual thinking, including how we imagine subjects and objects to exist as separate things.
You can't mistake a rope for a snake if there isn't even a rope there to begin with.
Think about how you can't have an illusion of a vase floating in empty space - you need actual materials like earth to create that illusion. Similarly, if there are no real external objects, what could make our mind mistake things like blue objects as being external? This shows we must accept that there is an impure dependent reality that makes things appear as separate subject and object. This same foundation is what causes both our bondage to suffering and our path to freedom through enlightenment.
According to both Madhyamaka and Cittamātra schools, when people see something and believe it truly exists exactly as they see it, they need to learn that what they're clinging to isn't really there in that way. When they understand this emptiness, it becomes a helpful spiritual path. But if people ignore this basic misunderstanding and instead try to prove some other kind of emptiness is real, they're wasting their time. This won't help overcome any of their deep-rooted habits of believing things truly exist, whether obvious or subtle, which they've had since the beginning of time.
When we look at how things appear to have two separate parts - like a viewer and what is being viewed - we can see that this is just an appearance of dependent nature. We realize that what we imagine to be truly existing in this way actually doesn't exist at all. This shows us that the basis is empty of what we're trying to deny exists. What's left over - the empty basis and its emptiness - these do truly exist. When we understand this correctly, we'll really get what emptiness means.
Here's what happened: The opposing view comes from two texts - the Bodhisattvabhūmi and the Madhyāntavibhāgaṭīkā. These texts explain the phrase "whatever is absent in whatever" in the way I mentioned before. Now, the Uttaratantra commentary explains this same phrase too, but in a completely different way - it uses a Madhyamaka approach. I could explain this in detail, but I won't because it would make this too long.
The dependent nature comes only from its own inner habits, without any outside objects to grab onto.
According to the Cittamātra system, things exist naturally and ultimately in a way that goes beyond all words and thoughts. This is because when we talk about inner and outer things, we're only grasping at their surface appearance without analyzing them deeply.
In simple terms, the dependent nature has three special qualities: it appears without any external objects, it exists naturally, and ultimately it cannot be an object of mental complications.
Whatever can be examined belongs to the group of things that exist by their own nature, so it is not separate from those three characteristics.
When we talk about the "dependent nature existing," we don't just mean it exists in a simple way - we mean it exists in a special way. Master Sthiramati explained this when he discussed the phrase "false imagination exists." He said we need to add the words "by its own nature" to complete the full meaning. It's really important to understand this difference for what comes next.
This section has two main parts: first, a detailed explanation of why certain ideas are wrong, and second, a wrap-up of these arguments. The first part breaks down into three sections: showing why the example of consciousness existing without external objects doesn't work, explaining why consciousness can't arise from mental habits without external objects, and showing how this fits with meditation practices about unpleasant things. The first section has two parts: disproving the dream example and disproving the example of seeing floating hairs. The dream example discussion has three parts: why dreams don't prove consciousness exists by itself, why dreams don't prove there's no external world when we're awake, and how dreams actually show everything is false. On the first point: Hey Cittamātrins, if you say there's no external world but consciousness exists on its own, what example can you give for this?
The Cittamātra philosophers say: "Here's a simple example - imagine you're sleeping in a tiny room and have a dream about a herd of crazy elephants. Obviously, those elephants can't actually be in that small room. Similarly, just like in a dream, while physical objects aren't real, we must accept that our consciousness definitely exists as something real." To show why this argument doesn't work, we should carefully examine this example.
What should we examine? Let's say there's a dream where your mind shows you a herd of drunk cattle. Even though this mind seems to exist in its own right, it actually doesn't exist in my view, just like there aren't really any elephants there. Why? Because it never truly came into being.
If consciousness doesn't have its own defining features, then the example you're using doesn't work for both sides of the argument, which means consciousness can't exist without an outside world.
Here's what this text is saying: Just because we say a dream elephant isn't real doesn't mean consciousness itself doesn't exist. Instead, we're saying consciousness doesn't have its own inherent existence. The Cittamātra school teaches about something called "dependent nature" that exists without external objects, and this dependent nature is thought to have inherent existence. When summarizing these arguments, the text says "Just like there's no object to be known, there's also no consciousness." The commentary explains this by saying that consciousness, which appears to have the characteristics of objects it knows, doesn't arise from its own nature.
Also, in both the root text and commentary, when they reject these kinds of ideas, they always add specific conditions to what they're rejecting. Also, the great master Candrakīrti himself asks "Why did they teach that mind comes from ignorance and karma?" He clearly accepts that ignorance creates karmic actions, and these actions create consciousness - this is definitely his view. So any smart person can see that his system definitely accepts consciousness exists. Therefore, whenever he talks about objects and consciousness being equally existent or non-existent, we need to understand this in terms of the specific conditions of what he's rejecting.
Someone might say: "If our mind isn't confused during dreams, then why can we remember our dream experiences after we wake up?" This is just arguing that if the mind doesn't exist in some solid, real way, then it must not exist at all.
Here's why this argument doesn't work: You say the mind must be real because we remember our dreams when we wake up. But if that's true, then everything we see in our dreams - like dream elephants - would have to be real too. Why? Because when you wake up, you remember both experiencing the dream (which you say proves the mind is real) and seeing things in the dream. So you have to either admit that both the dream objects and the mind are real, or accept that neither of them truly exists.
You might wonder: if our system accepts that we can remember both what we saw in dreams and how we experienced them, how do we explain whether these things actually existed or not? The Commentary explains this by talking about two kinds of memory - remembering that we had a dream, and remembering what we experienced in it. Think about when you see an elephant in a dream. It's like looking at your reflection in a mirror - your eye consciousness doesn't actually see your real face, but it does experience seeing the reflection. Similarly, in a dream, while you're not experiencing a real elephant, you are experiencing something that appears as an elephant. So when we say we remember the dream object, what we're really remembering is our experience of seeing it.
When we look at things and experience them, we usually don't need to treat these as different things, except in a few special cases. This means we can't prove that things exist in our mind alone without any outside world, because we can't find any real examples of this. In some cases, like when we try to prove past and future lives exist, we might not have direct examples but can still prove it using different logical methods. But here, we don't even have that option. This shows that the arguments against the Cittamātra view are very strong.
Here's the second point: Let's say you see an elephant in your dream. If that dream elephant exists, then you'd need working eyes to see it, right? But that doesn't make sense. When you're asleep, your eyes don't work because sleep interferes with them. So you can't actually see an elephant with your eyes in a dream - only your mind is aware of it. This proves that there aren't really any physical objects out there. Instead, your mind just creates images that seem like external things, and you can't help but think they're real outside objects.
Someone might say that dreams show us how our mind works without needing outside objects, and claim this proves the same thing happens when we're awake. Even if we set aside earlier arguments, they think dreams prove that consciousness exists without external things. But this doesn't work, because even in dreams, mental consciousness doesn't truly exist on its own. Even if we agree there are no physical forms in dreams, you can't have mental consciousness existing by itself - not even in dreams. So you can't use this as an example to prove both that external things don't exist and that mental consciousness exists independently.
Think about dreams - just like objects you see in dreams aren't really there, your mind's awareness isn't really created either. It's like this: when you're awake and see something, three things work together - your eye, the thing you see, and your mind. The same happens in dreams - when you notice something, these same three things come together in your mind.
Just like in a dream when we have no real eyes or things to see, we also don't have the awareness that comes from seeing things with our eyes. So in dreams, our eyes, the things we see, and our mind that sees them are all just make-believe.
Similarly, just like the three eye faculties, the three faculties of ear and other senses are not naturally produced.
Here's what the text means: When we say "and so forth," we're including everything from sounds and hearing consciousness up to mind, mental elements, and mental consciousness. Just like with the eye and seeing that was explained before, there are four senses (from ear to body), four objects (from sound to touch), and four types of consciousness (like hearing consciousness). In dreams, these things aren't really there, but they appear to be, so they're false. The three mental aspects exist in dreams but are also false because they seem to exist independently when they don't.$$Some people wrongly claim that according to this master's teachings, sense consciousness exists in dreams, and then they try to argue against this idea. This shows they really don't understand the teachings. It's like trying to criticize something before you even understand it properly. Some Tibetan scholars who think they're experts don't even understand the basics of what these great bodhisattva masters taught. They're actually creating negative karma for themselves and leading others to do the same. We should be very careful about this.
Here's what happened: The Cittamātra school made an argument using dreams as an example. Master Bhāviveka tried to counter this by saying their example doesn't work. He claimed that in dreams, the mind still perceives mental objects, so consciousness always needs an object. But this argument doesn't work either. Why? Because in dreams, none of the three things (objects, senses, and consciousness) can truly exist. If someone accepts these three things exist in dreams just to prove their opponent wrong, then using dreams as an example becomes pointless. After all, if you're saying dreams are real rather than false, you can't use them to show how real things are false. The main point is that even in dreams, these three things don't have any real, independent existence.
Here's what we're saying: In dreams, you can't have a mental form that exists separately from consciousness itself. While we have to accept that such forms exist, and it's fine to say they appear in dreams, Bhāviveka's view that these forms have their own independent existence actually helps prove why they don't really exist at all.
Here's the problem: The Cittamātra school says nothing exists outside the mind, and they use dreams as an example. If you try to argue against this by saying physical things must exist inherently, then you've created another problem - you can't use the Madhyamaka teaching that uses dreams to show nothing truly exists.
A dream has real meaning and isn't just made up, since it exists with its own characteristics. When we use a dream as an example, we can't prove that the actual things it represents are false. This is because until we disprove that things exist independently, we can't use the logical parts (sign, property, and example) to prove things don't truly exist. That's why our earlier explanation - that everything appearing in dreams lacks independent existence - was exactly right.
If we ask whether our tradition accepts that the forms we see clearly in dreams are considered mental objects: Since we have no physical senses working in dreams, the five types of objects we seem to see are only appearing in our mind. So even though we can't say there are actual physical objects like forms there, just like when we mentally visualize a skeleton clearly, these dream appearances are mental objects. Specifically, they are imagined forms among the five types of forms. This principle helps us understand many similar cases.
Think about dreams - in them we see objects, our senses, and our awareness, but none of these are real. This shows us that dreams aren't real. We can use this understanding to show how other things also aren't real in the same way. So even when we're awake, we can prove that nothing has any real, independent existence.
Think about dreams - the things we see, our senses, and our awareness in dreams aren't real. In the same way, when we're awake, nothing around us is truly real either. This means our mind doesn't truly exist on its own, just like the things we see, hear, and feel through our senses aren't really there, and our senses themselves don't naturally exist. The sutra explains this by saying: "Just like watching magical creatures that seem real but aren't, the Tathāgata taught that everything is like magic tricks and dreams." It also says: "Everyone in cyclic existence is like people in a dream - nobody is really born or dies. You can't find any real living beings, humans, or life force. Everything is as hollow as foam or as empty as a banana tree." This explains these teachings well.
The teaching about "nobody being born" should be understood like the earlier example that says things "aren't real in their true nature." When these Buddhist texts use dreams as an example to show that nothing exists exactly as it appears, this fits well with what Madhyamaka teaches but doesn't work for Cittamātra. That's why scholars say this is a good explanation.
In this world, some people are awake from normal sleep but still caught in the sleep of ignorance. Even though nothing truly exists on its own, they see things as if in a dream due to ignorance. They experience objects, senses, and consciousness as real. The same applies to those who haven't woken up yet - as long as they remain asleep, they also experience these three things as real.
When you wake up from sleep, the three parts of your dream disappear. In the same way, when buddhas completely wake up from the sleep of confusion and directly experience ultimate reality, none of these three things exist for them. This means there can't be consciousness without an outside world.
When a buddha sees things as they truly are, they don't see these three things at all. When seeing things as they appear in the everyday world, while the buddha's own mind isn't clouded by the effects of ignorance and so doesn't see false appearances, they can still understand what others see because they can perceive how things appear to people whose minds are still affected by ignorance.
Second, the Cittamātra school might argue: "Look at how people with eye problems can see floating hairs that aren't really there. This proves that consciousness exists by itself, even without external objects." But this argument doesn't work.
Why? When someone has an eye problem and sees floating hairs because of this problem, then from their point of view, both what they see with their eyes and the floating hairs they think they're seeing are real things that exist.
When someone with healthy vision looks at something, they don't see floating hairs like a person with eye problems does. Both the appearance of these floating hairs and the mind that sees them are false - they were never really there. This is because you can't really have a mind perceiving something if there isn't even something appearing to be seen. We have to accept this as definitely true.
This is incorrect. Here's why: Suppose someone with eye floaters sees floating hairs that aren't really there, and their mind truly believes these hairs exist. If that were true, then anyone else looking at the exact same spot would also see these floating hairs, even if they don't have eye floaters. This is because in both cases, there are no real hairs there to begin with.
Here's a similar example: Just like if something truly exists and comes from something else, it would have to come from everything else too. In the same way, if there was a truly existing awareness, then since both people (with and without eye disease) equally don't have floating hairs in front of them, it wouldn't make sense that someone with eye disease sees floating hairs while someone without eye disease doesn't see them. This is because this awareness wouldn't need to depend on having eye disease, so there would be no connection between them.
If someone has healthy eyes, they won't see floating hairs that aren't there. Similarly, consciousness cannot exist independently of external objects while being inherently real.
The second main topic has three parts: First, we'll examine whether our awareness of objects comes from ripened or unripened mental habits. Second, we'll look at whether awareness can exist without external objects. Third, we'll show that rejecting the Cittamātra view doesn't go against scripture. Let's start with the first part, which has two sections: explaining the other side's view and then proving it wrong. Here's their view: If seeing things like floating hairs happened because those things actually existed, then even people with healthy eyes would see floating hairs. But that's not what happens. So what's really going on? They say it's because of mental habits from our past - when these habits are ready to show results, we see things, and when they're not ready, we don't. So only people who have ripe mental habits from previously seeing hairs will see floating hairs.
People with healthy eyes who can see clearly don't experience visions of floating hairs because their mind hasn't developed the tendency to see such things. It's not that the floating hairs don't exist as something that could be known - it's just that the mind doesn't create that perception.
The second section has three parts: showing why potential can't truly exist in the present, showing why potential can't truly exist in the future, and showing why potential can't truly exist in the past. For the first part: If there was such a thing as truly existing potential, we might say that consciousness appears or doesn't appear depending on whether this potential has ripened or not. But since there isn't any such truly existing potential, this idea doesn't work.
Someone might ask: "Why isn't this possible?" When we think about this ability or potential, does it have to be connected to our present awareness, or to our past and future awareness? Let's look at this carefully: First, something that exists right now can't have any kind of built-in or natural potential. Similarly, something that hasn't happened yet can't have any potential either.
Let's say someone claims that potentiality exists in our present consciousness. This would mean both consciousness and potentiality exist at the same time. When we use the possessive case to say "consciousness of potentiality," showing how potentiality and its possessor relate, these two things can't be different from each other. Therefore, it doesn't make sense for consciousness with potentiality to actually be the potentiality itself. If it were, an effect would have no cause separate from itself, and when a sprout grows, its seed would never break down.
When we say "cognition comes from potentiality," using the fifth case ending, it doesn't make sense for cognition to come from a potentiality that exists at the same time as the cognition. This is because it would mean the result exists at the same time as its cause. Therefore, there can't be any potentiality that causes present cognition.
Here's the second point: Let's talk about whether unborn consciousness has potential. When we say "potential of consciousness," we're using potential as the basic thing we're describing and consciousness as the way we're describing it. When we look at future consciousness that hasn't been born yet, we can't definitively say "this is consciousness," and we also can't definitively say "this is not consciousness" as if that were naturally true.
If a future consciousness isn't here right now as a present consciousness, how could anyone say "this potential belongs to that consciousness"? They couldn't.
In other words, you can't have a special ability without the consciousness that defines it. If that wasn't true, then we might as well say that a barren woman's son has special abilities too - which makes no sense!
Someone might think about consciousness and its potential like this: "Here's how it works - there's a potential, and from that potential, consciousness will arise." They compare it to everyday examples, like when we say "Cook the rice" or "Make cloth from this thread" - we're thinking about the future rice and cloth. They also point to the Treasury of Abhidharma, which talks about three types entering the womb: the universal monarch and two self-arisen ones. Just like we talk about someone entering the womb who will become a universal monarch, they say we can talk about consciousness's potential while thinking about future consciousness.$$But this doesn't work. Here's why: If something exists sometimes, its effect will appear later. But things that never exist - like a barren woman's son or unconditioned space - won't appear now or ever. So even if we accept that consciousness could come from real potential, since future consciousness doesn't inherently exist at any time, there can't be any potential to produce it. Just like a barren woman's son, without any real potential to produce consciousness, no inherently real consciousness can arise.
When Madhyamaka philosophers discuss why a sprout can't truly exist on its own, they make this point: If you say a sprout can appear even though it didn't exist when it was just a seed, then you might as well say rabbit horns could appear too! But here's what they really mean: If something truly existed on its own, then if it doesn't exist at one time, it can't exist at any time - just like things that never exist at all, like rabbit horns. They're not saying that things can't appear after not existing before - that would be silly. This same idea works for things like cooked rice too. If things had to exist by themselves completely, then future things like cooked rice would have to be totally non-existent.
Also, if we say something has the potential to create consciousness in the future, and then say consciousness exists because of that potential - this means they depend on each other to exist. If we accept this view, then as the sublime masters with great wisdom have taught, consciousness cannot truly exist by itself.
The Commentary tells us that things like "long and short" or "this side and that side" only exist because we label them that way - they don't have any built-in existence of their own. We should understand that we're not saying these things don't exist at all; we're just saying they don't exist independently. When Cittamātra followers talk this way, they're actually agreeing with what we say. This means that consciousness doesn't have any natural power over future things.
Here's the third point: To show that past events have no power either, let me explain. Let's say a consciousness arises and then starts to fade away. As it fades, it leaves an impression in the foundation consciousness - like a seed that will grow into something similar later. If you believe that when this seed matures, it creates a new future consciousness, then you're saying that something completely separate and independent is creating this new consciousness. Why is this a problem? Because in your view, each moment in a sequence is completely separate from the others, with its own independent nature.
The word for "continuum" comes from the root word tanu, which means "to expand." When you add a suffix to this root, it creates a word meaning "continuous flow." Think of it like a river - just as water flows continuously, causes and effects follow each other without breaks. This is similar to how birth and death happen one after another without gaps. We're talking about changing things that connect past, present and future in each moment. A continuum isn't just about things happening one after another without breaks - it's made up of tiny moments that are its parts. These momentary parts belong to the continuum, so we call them "parts of the continuum." The continuum owns these parts, just like a pot owns its spout, neck, and other pieces.
The opponent says that earlier and later moments are completely different from each other, and that they are separate things with their own unique features. This means that one thing comes from the power of another thing that exists in its own right.
If you say "This isn't a problem because I accept it," then you'd have to accept that everything could come from anything else.
Even though each moment in a sequence is different from the next, they all belong to the same continuous stream. Because of this, we don't have the problem of saying that anything can come from anything else. This is how we answer the criticism about things arising from other things.
Let's say we're trying to prove that two separate things can share one continuous stream of existence. Even if we accept this idea without problems, we still need to prove it first because it hasn't been proven yet. Why? Because it doesn't make sense to say that completely separate things can share one continuous stream. For example, Maitreya and Upagupta are different people, so they can't share the same mental stream. In the same way, things that exist at different times and are completely separate can't logically share the same continuous stream. This helps us answer the problem about things being produced from other things.
Here's what's happening: Someone says that rice plants grow from rice seeds as part of one natural sequence, while barley sprouts come from a different sequence. They use this to argue against the idea that "anything can come from anything." But Candrakīrti points out that this defense doesn't work because they're assuming things have their own fixed, separate nature. This isn't about simple differences between things - it's specifically about things having their own independent existence. Some people miss this point and make up their own explanations instead of understanding why Candrakīrti said this defense fails. This misrepresents the true philosophical teaching.
The second part has two sections: explaining what others believe and showing why they are wrong. First, after explaining the previous part, the Cittamātra teachers thought they could prove their point by explaining their own view. They said that when one type of consciousness stops working, it leaves behind seeds in the foundation consciousness that can create new eye consciousness later. When these seeds mature, they produce a new eye consciousness that looks like the previous one.
What we think is our physical eye is actually just the basis for our eye consciousness - it's not a separate thing. People in the world mistakenly think there's a physical eye organ because they don't understand this truth. The same goes for all our other physical senses - they're not separate from consciousness either.
When eye consciousness arises, the mental habits that cause it act as its causal condition, while the physical eye faculty acts as its controlling condition.
When we say the eye faculty directly causes visual consciousness, we're specifically talking about times when the seeds for eye consciousness have fully developed - not just any instance of eye faculty.
According to the Madhyāntavibhāga text: When our mind sees objects, living beings, and a self, these appearances arise in consciousness but aren't real external things. This teaching explains that when our foundation consciousness creates appearances of physical objects and the five senses, it's all happening within consciousness itself. The Buddhist master Sthiramati also taught that our physical sense organs are just objects appearing in the foundation consciousness. So followers of the Cittamātra school who believe in foundation consciousness say that things like our eyes and other sense organs are just appearances within this foundation consciousness.
First, we learn that our sense organs like eyes don't exist separately from our mind. Then, Cittamātra teaches that physical objects aren't separate from our mind either. Here's what this means: When our five senses show us things like the color blue, these experiences come from seeds stored in our foundation consciousness (ālaya), not from outside objects. But because people don't understand this, they mistakenly think these mental experiences of blue and other things are real objects existing outside their minds.
